<p>Idaho National Laboratory Project Office (INLPO) publication types include journal articles, conference proceedings, university theses, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Series, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission reports, and Idaho Department of Water Administration reports. The percentage frequency distribution of INLPO publication types is provided in table 1. And the number of citations per year is shown in figure 1. USGS-Series publications compose the largest percentage of the INLPO bibliography at 68.0 percent. The mean number of publications per year is 5.2, with a standard deviation of 3.5.</p>
