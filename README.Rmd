## Description

The [R] package **inlpubs** may be used to search and analyze `r nrow(inlpubs::pubs)` publications that cover the `r diff(range(as.integer(apply(inlpubs::pubs, 1, function(x) x$citation$year)))) + 1L`-year history of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Idaho Water Science Center, [Idaho National Laboratory Project Office] (INLPO). The INLPO publications were authored by `r sum(!duplicated(do.call("c", inlpubs::pubs$citation$author)))` researchers trying to better understand the effects of waste disposal on water contained in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer and the availability of water for long-term consumptive and industrial use. Information contained within these publications is crucial to the management and use of the aquifer by the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) and the State of Idaho. USGS geohydrologic studies and monitoring, which began in 1949, were done in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy Idaho Operations Office.
