## Perkins2000

This report is the last in a series of five data reports that provide information for estimating the potential for migration of radionuclides in the unsaturated zone at the RWMC. The report describes the final phase of a multiphase study of the geohydrology of the RWMC. The report presents hydrologic and meteorological data collected during 1997-99 at a designated test trench area established by the USGS in 1985 adjacent to the northern boundary of the RWMC Subsurface Disposal Area. During 1997–99, soil-moisture content was measured approximately monthly in 13 neutron-probe access holes using a neutron moisture gage. Meteorological data collected at the test trench area during 1997–98 included air temperature, precipitation, net radiation, wind speed, wind direction, soil-surface temperature, soil-heat flux, and relative humidity.

## MorrisOthers1965

Generally, this report presents USGS activities during 1964 with emphasis on geology, geochemistry, hydrology, and collection of basic records.

Geology.—Much of the geologic work presented was based on previously collected information supplemented with data collected in 1964. The comprehensive geologic study included

1. an updated (from the 1955 map) and expanded surface geology map (fig. 1) prepared from an analysis of aerial photographs from the 1949 coverage and from field verification activities;
2. an aeroradioactivity survey conducted in 1964 that was used to prepare maps showing basalt types (fig. 2) and relative basalt ages (fig. 3) at the NRTS and the surrounding area;
3. definition of a physiographic depression that occupies most of the NRTS and Mud Lake area (fig. 4) and correlates well with the map showing structural features such as lineaments and faults (fig. 5) that were plotted using preliminary seismic studies and field mapping (examples of lineaments and faults are shown in figs. 6–7);
4. depiction of the general tectonic characteristics of the NRTS and vicinity, including a map showing the relation of the Bannock Overthrust and related erosional features to the NRTS (fig. 8), a seismic profile across part of the mouth of the Birch Creek Valley (fig. 9), and a generalized cross section of the northern NRTS based on seismic, gravity, and aeromagnetic surveys and surface feature mapping (fig 10);
5. preliminary plots of the results of gravity and aeromagnetic surveys (figs. 11 and 12), and refraction data between wells USGS 31 and 33 (fig. 13);
6. identification of a zone of high permeability (fig. 14) that was used in conjunction with the gravity, aeromagnetic, and refraction data to infer a structural graben-type feature located in the southern to southeastern part of the NRTS;
7. delineation by sector of anticipated subsurface geologic conditions at the NRTS (fig. 15), the estimated thickness of Cenozoic rocks in each sector (table 1), and the estimated depths and characteristics of the rocks in each sector (table 2);
8. evaluation of the feasibility of using K-40/Ar-40 radiometric dating techniques (0.47 percent of basalt from 4 samples was K and of the K, 0.012 percent was K-40) by examining thin sections from several samples from the GIN site and the report by Roland Kologrivov (Isotopes, Inc., written commun. to authors, March 30, 1965), which also summarizes the mineralogy of the 20 samples;
9. the methods of cutting, preparing, and studying cores and well cuttings, and textural and mineralogic descriptions of eight samples from the GIN site (authors conclude that Snake River Plain basalt weathering is generally proportional to depth);
10. an experimental technique for evaluation of geophysical logs, which included direct comparison of measured bulk densities and gamma intensities of core- and drill-cutting materials and subsequent comparisons to density, natural gamma, and hole-diameter logs to improve geophysical log interpretations (the gross gamma intensities of Tertiary silicic material, 0.00075–0.0035 mr/hr, were two to seven times larger than the average intensities for SRP basaltic rocks and the gamma intensities of mineralized fractures in basalt also were larger than those of the unweathered basalt);
11. a summary of the seminar subjects in the May 1964 seminar at the NRTS entitled Features of Geologic Structure that was cosponsored by the USGS and the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC); and
12. results of a trial collaboration among the AEC, the USGS, and the academic community wherein a graduate student [from the Association of Rocky Mountain Universities] was sponsored by the AEC and the USGS to study geologic and geophysical data at the NRTS and to develop new means for analyzing data. The trial collaboration established a precedent that is still being followed today; the principal conclusion of the student’s study was that better results are derived from using a wide variety rather than just one of a few analytical tools.

Geochemistry.—The geochemistry work was based partly on the study of geophysical applications to describe chemistry changes in boreholes and analytical techniques to describe changes in aquifer chemistry related to waste disposal, both at selected facilities and sitewide. The geochemical studies included

1. a description of the Tracejector study, which was begun in 1963 and continued in 1964 with the testing of 20 wells using the Tracejecter, specific conductance logs, and well construction information to determine flow direction and velocity and their relation to borehole water chemistry (direction of vertical flow in most of the 20 wells studied was downward and examples of the method for wells USGS 28 and 4, Site 17, and MTR Test are shown in figures 19–21 and 23);
2. use of water-resistivity-temperature geophysical logs in conjunction with specific conductance measurements to determine temporal changes in water chemistry. It was concluded that there were no short-term changes in chemistry, but that waste disposal could be identified at some locations; and,
3. identification of changes in water quality and radioactivity during 1964 at the CCP (now INTEC) area, the TRA area, and sitewide by using sodium, specific conductance, gamma activity, and tritium.

Hydrology.—Hydrologic information presented includes detailed summaries of drilling and well preparation for the gas-injection test with information on well construction, well completion, and well records; a study describing the TRA waste-disposal ponds; a study describing the recompletion and testing of the TRA waste-disposal well; a study on the significance of specific capacity of wells; the effect of the Alaskan earthquake on water levels at the NRTS; and, a study of the regional hydrology at the NRTS.

Special studies.—Several special studies are summarized and include studies on thermo-conductivity, air-flow characteristics of basalt, relation of pond levels to water levels in the regional system and the perched-water systems, and field-scale dispersion.

Collection of basic records.—During 1964, records were collected and documented for the sitewide drilling program, the sitewide geophysical logging program, the sitewide sampling and water-level measurement program, water utilization, and the sitewide well modification program.

The report also provides a discussion on the future scope of USGS programs at the NRTS.

## MorrisOthers1964

As part of the effort to provide a regional description of the NRTS and surrounding areas, this report gives the results of a geohydrologic study at the NRTS and adjoining areas and also provides results of smaller site-specific studies. Results of the regional studies include a generalized Bouger gravity anomaly map, a preliminary aeromagnetic traverse flown at 500 ft, and aeromagnetic profiles along five different flight lines. The gravity and aeromagnetic data were used to formulate a conceptual model of the Little Lost River drainage at its mouth and to prepare maps depicting regional physiographic features, generalized stratigraphic cross sections at and north of the NRTS, and areas of intense regional faulting. The data also were used to delineate locations of a ground-water barrier, lineaments, and faults in basalt at the NRTS.

The sitewide ground-water sampling network in 1963 consisted of 21 wells and 10 surface-water sites (table 3). The report recommends adding wells USGS 33, and 3A, Atomic City, USGS 83, 9, and 8 to the sitewide network. In addition, 22 ground-water wells were sampled in the CCP (now INTEC) area (table 1), and 18 perched wells and 7 ground-water wells were sampled in the MTR-ETR (now TRA) area (table 2). The constituents analyzed generally included gamma radiation, sodium, and specific conductance; however, some wells were sampled for a complete suite of constituents.

The report also presents results of a comprehensive study at the NRF site for the first time. The study focused on the distribution of radioactivity in the subsurface associated with disposal to infiltration ponds ECF–A1W and S1W. Auger holes were installed near the ponds, and contour maps depicting the top of the first basalt layer and the tops of the overlying perched-water bodies were prepared. These results were displayed in figures 19–20, 23–25, and 29. Cross sections through the ponds are shown in figures 21–22 and 27–28. In February 1963, radioactive contaminants were released unexpectedly to the MTR (now TRA) Retention Basin and Pond. The release was the largest up to that time, and movement of the waste through the regolith was monitored. Interpretation of natural gamma logs implied that the movement of waste was controlled by regolith geometry. Interpretation of gamma activity in water samples was less conclusive.

At the ICPP (now INTEC) Cutting Facility, the development of a perched-water body and the movement of low-level radioactive waste from a shallow disposal well was monitored by means of 27 auger holes drilled through the alluvium to the first basalt layer (see fig. 34). The formation of perched water and its movement was controlled by the configuration of the basalt layer. When the perched-water zone reached saturation, additional water was transmitted to the basalt. The geometry of the waste-disposal system also was documented. Also at the ICPP, a field study of dispersion using tritium indicated the weakness of tritium analytical methods. It was decided to start archiving water samples for analysis subsequent to improvement of the analytical methods.

To evaluate the disposal of radioactive gas to the subsurface several injection tests were done at the ICPP and TAN. Straight air, propane, or helium as a gas tracer were injected both above and below the water table.

The report provides a brief discussion of an experimental logging tool known as the Tracejector that measured velocity and direction of fluid flow in a borehole. Results were provided for two wells at the ICPP and one at the TRA. The method consisted of injecting I-131 into the borehole and tracking its movement with a gamma-ray logging tool. The geology and geography of the TAN-LOFT areas including a generalized surface geology map (fig. 53) and two cross sections perpendicular to the Birch Creek drainage, one through the TAN (fig. 54) and the other through the PW wells in the mouth of the valley (fig. 55).

When well USGS 7 originally was drilled, perched water was encountered at 108 ft. Water-level studies in the TAN area reconfirmed that a narrow zone of low permeability stretches from the vicinity of well USGS 25 southeastward to the southern boundary of the TAN study area (fig. 56). Water levels in wells west of the zone responded to variation in underflow from Birch Creek, and those east of the zone responded to changes in flow from the Mud Lake area. Some specific-capacity data for wells in this area and other generalized hydrologic data are provided. In the TAN study area, a thin layer of fresher water at the water table was noted from specific-conductance data.

A detailed description of ground-water chemistry in the TAN-LOFT area, based on the work of Olmsted (IDO–22043– USGS), is given. A study of specific capacity was conducted at the NRTS and an areal view of the results was presented in figure 52. The maximum, minimum, and mean values of selected ions and physical parameters are provided in table 8; the chemical character of water samples and distribution of water types (A or B) identified by Olmsted is given in figure 58; and the distribution of sodium plus potassium, chloride, and temperature is shown in figures 59–61. The authors concluded that wells located away from contaminated areas reflect natural chemistry and that two zones of water chemistry are present: an eastern zone related to Mud Lake recharge and a western zone related to Birch Creek recharge. These types of waters generally were within the upper 50 to 200 ft of the saturated zone; the more dilute, fresher water occupied the upper 50 ft of the saturated zone. The temperature data in figure 61 indicates the presence of a plume of cooler Birch Creek water at the TAN-LOFT area trending perpendicular to the regional south to southwest direction of flow of the Snake River Plain aquifer. The report establishes a relation between specific conductance and the sum of ionized constituents for the TAN-LOFT area on the basis of 11 analytical results for samples from 8 wells: 0.543 times specific conductance equals the sum of ionized constituents. Guidelines on well construction and an evaluation of four potential methods for disposing of waste at the TAN-LOFT area are provided. This report describes the configuration of the upper and lower perched zones at the M-ETR and the effects of the waste pipeline break that was discovered in 1963. Figures 62–69 show water-level contours at various times during the repair of the break and the subsequent recovery of water levels in monitoring boreholes. Detailed descriptions of the effects of the break and its repair are provided. Efforts to collect basic records continued in 1963 and a substantial amount of drilling took place; 131 test holes totaling about 3,400 ft were drilled and 53 of these test holes totaling about 1,700 ft were cased with PVC. Solid-phase samples were collected and analyzed, and results were used to define characteristics of the regolith at several proposed facility sites: (1) LOFT site, 29 test holes were used to prepare an alluvium thickness map, 3 cross sections were prepared, and coefficients of permeability for 26 samples, specific gravities, dry unit weights, moisture equivalents, specific retentions, total porosities, specific yields, and grain-size distributions for 9 samples were determined; (2) SET site, 36 test holes were used to prepare an alluvium thickness map, 4 cross sections were prepared, and coefficients of permeability, specific gravities, dry unit weights, moisture equivalents, specific retentions, total porosities, specific yields, and grain-size distributions for 13 samples were determined; (3) A & M Test site, 4 test holes were used to prepare an alluvium thickness map; and (4) NTF site, boreholes were used to define the minimum thickness of the alluvium at 9 locations. To supplement the data previously collected, 53 other boreholes were drilled as follows: 5 at MTR, 25 at NRF, and 23 at CPP. Also, the geophysical-logging program, the water-quality monitoring program, and the water-level monitoring program all yielded significant amounts of data. Plans to conduct a deep-well project (INEL-1?) were mentioned in this report.

## MorrisOthers1963

This report describes in detail several early USGS studies at the NRTS, both small-scale and sitewide, and provides a roadmap for future work.

Small-scale studies.—Fluorescein dye was used at the MTR-ETR (now TRA) to evaluate lateral movement of perched water. Some striking observations were noted. Lateral movements of perched waters at MTR/ETR were identified as follows:

1. Perched water in shallow alluvium, as much as 20 ft/hour;
2. Perched water in moderately deep zones, 1.5 to 4.9 ft/day; and
3. Perched water in deeper zones, as much as 10 ft/day.

In 1956, the background concentration of tritium was estimated to be less than 150 pCi/L. Tritium was first discovered in the aquifer in 1962 at well MTR Test (66,240 pCi/L) and was attributed to leakage down the casing of water that originated from the MTR pond. Monitoring of tritium in ground water and the waste stream was initiated at that time. At the ICPP (now INTEC), tritium was used to estimate ground-water flow velocities by first-arrival time (19–141 ft/day with an average of 60 ft/day) and by center of mass methods (10–13 ft/day). At the MTR-ETR and ICPP areas, sodium was evaluated as a potential indicator for pH, specific conductance, beta activity, and gamma activity. No correlations were observed and sodium sampling was reduced to the level required for monitoring long-term trends.

At the MTR-ETR a comprehensive, 60-day study to identify the effects of attenuation, dispersion, and dilution was conducted during October and November 1962. One of the important conclusions was that zones of higher permeability exist in the subsurface.

Also at the MTR-ETR, a study to estimate infiltration rates caused by increasing the water level in the ponds indicated that 16,000 to 50,000 gal/hour infiltrated through the pond bottoms. Several basalt test holes and 37 auger holes were drilled near MTR-ETR to recover solid-phase material, to delineate perched-water bodies, to measure water levels, to collect water samples, and to provide access for neutron moisture and natural gamma logging.

Sitewide studies.—Water levels were measured (1,050 measurements) as part of a comprehensive water-level monitoring program and to develop a sitewide water-level map, water-level change maps for different time periods, and several hydrographs. From these data it was concluded that a barrier to horizontal flow, oriented approximately north to south, exists in the subsurface. East of the barrier, Mud Lake recharge controls water levels. West of the barrier, wells respond to recharge from Birch Creek and Little Lost River. In 1962, recharge by surface infiltration of snowmelt and high rainfall was significant.

About 2,000 ft of drilling took place in 1962, and about 700 ft was for the purpose of locating a “Burial Ground Site.” A total of 109,000 ft of hole was logged by gammaray, density, borehole-diameter, water-resistivity, water temperature, or experimental magnetometer techniques.

A comprehensive water-quality sampling program was initiated in 1962. Seventeen complete water samples and 450 to 900 water samples each for tritium, specific conductance, sodium, and gamma radiation were collected. Other USGS offices were conducting research using petrologic, magnetic, and deep-seismic studies.

Roadmap.—A roadmap for USGS activities at the NRTS was put forth and included continuing small-scale site-specific studies and extending the scope of operations to more accurately describe the regional hydrogeologic environment at the NRTS. Techniques to be used included regional geophysical studies to define the depth of the aquifer, hydraulic and tracer-test studies to refine rates and directions of ground-water flow, and additional studies to refine the knowledge of water chemistry.

## Olmsted1962

This report briefly summarizes significant reports about the NRTS that were published between 1902 and 1961. On page 11, Olmsted observes that velocity and direction of flow can vary locally depending on the character of the aquifer and that the regional representation of the flow system is useful for describing water chemistry.

The report contains analytical results for 148 samples collected from 92 wells during the period 1949–61 (Table 1). Listed in table 1 are results from all the reliable samples collected during 1949–56 that were published in IDO–22034–USGS (Appendix 2). Olmsted used the data in table 1 to categorize ground water at the NRTS into four chemical types (A-D) on the basis of proportions of dissolved ions (an early use of the concept of hydrochemical facies, see fig. 2):

A. Calcium and magnesium constitute more than 85 percent of the cations and bicarbonate constitutes more than 70 percent of the anions;
B. Calcium and magnesium constitute less than 85 percent of the cations (that is, sodium and potassium constitute more than 15 percent of the cations) and bicarbonate constitutes more than 70 percent of the anions;
C. No limits on cations but bicarbonate constitutes less than 70 percent of anions; and
D. No limits on cations; bicarbonate constitutes less than 70 percent and sulfate constitutes more than 30 percent of the anions.

Type A water represents recharge from the north and northwest, where the predominant rock type is limestone and dolomite. Type B water represents recharge from the east and northeast, where the dominant rock type is silicic volcanic rocks. Types C and D waters represent recharge from waste disposal, agricultural water use, and other sources such as thermal springs. Olmsted also mapped these areas (figs. 7–10) and made the first delineation of two zones of water quality that roughly divide the NRTS along a northeast-southwest trending line. Variations of water chemistry through time were determined to be the result, for the most part, of waste disposal. Exceptions were the chemistry of water in wells USGS 6 and 20, which were deepened, and water in wells USGS 2, 5, 30, and CFA 2. Variations of water chemistry with depth were observed in USGS 7 and 15, and were attributed to mixing caused by upward flow of water from the deeper silicic rocks. Olmsted also noted a zone of more dilute water floating on top of more mineralized water and attributed this to local recharge of infiltrating precipitation or locally ponded surface water. This layer is less than 50 ft thick and is present everywhere except at the mouth of the Birch Creek Valley. The report describes the method used for converting resistivity logs to conductance logs.

Temperature was found to be less variable vertically than areally (in the upper 200 ft of saturated material). This was attributed to shallow surface-water recharge from the Big Lost River channel, Mud Lake, the playas, and the spreading areas. Higher temperature wastewater equilibrates rapidly with aquifer water after disposal. Olmsted concluded that density differences of waste relative to native ground water affect the waste movement. When initially injected, waste was sufficiently warm to decrease the density relative to ground water and cause the wastewater to float. As the wastewater cooled, dissolved-solids content became more prevalent and the density was higher relative to ground water, which caused the wastewater to sink. Temperature also caused variability in viscosity; if hydraulic conductivity is held constant, water at 67 °F moves 23.6 percent faster than water at 49 °F. This might help explain local variability in flow velocity and direction.

Finally the report makes specific recommendations for future work. Locations for 10 additional monitoring wells were identified to help fill in data gaps. It was also recommended that systematic sampling for water quality be initiated on a regular time schedule and for a specified set of constituents.

## Jones1961a

This report describes the use of borehole geophysics to provide data for analysis of the hydrologic aspects of disposal and attenuation at the NRTS. The value of the report is that it identifies the intercept wells designed for tracking contaminant migration from the ICPP Disposal well (now CPP 3). The report also shows the use of geophysical techniques at the NRTS (for the first time) to be useful in identifying the hydrologic characteristics of the aquifer and the distribution of the sodium-chloride (Na-Cl) plume. Table 1 shows the volume of waste delivered to the ICPP Disposal well, including the curies of beta-gamma and alpha radioactivity by year for 1953–60 and the totals for the entire period. Figure 1 shows the thickness of the so-called “540-ft” aquifer, which is the best aquifer (zone?) in the upper 700 ft of the Snake River Plain aquifer. Figure 1 also shows the location of the 16 older (USGS 34–49) and five newer (USGS 51, 52, 57, 59, and 67) intercept wells. Figure 2 shows natural gamma and caliper logs and figure 3 shows resistivity and temperature logs for wells USGS 43, 47, 49, and 59 (both figs. 2 and 3 also show lithologic logs for these wells). Figure 4 shows the 1960 distribution of Na in the ICPP (now INTEC) study area.

## Jones1961b

For this report, the author used the data from IDO–22041–USGS was used to make comprehensive hydrologic interpretations about the ICPP (now INTEC) and MTR-ETR (now TRA) study areas (figs. 6–8, 12–14). ICPP: Jones concluded that aqueous radioactive and chemical wastes discharged to the disposal well in the ICPP area flow radially away from the disposal well in a multiple aquifer system in the Snake River basalt. The regional gradient in head southwestward causes the wastewater to move generally in that direction; however, locally the preferred direction is a function of the geometry of the aquifer system. Flow rates and flowpaths could be analyzed effectively only by studying each aquifer singly. Accordingly, the five principal aquifers that occur locally in the 460 to 660 ft depth interval were identified as aquifers A, B, C, D, and E. These were mapped with reference to thickness and structure (figs. 9–11, 15–27) and tested individually for head (figs. 28–34) and water quality (figs. 38–55, and 56–58). To obtain hydraulic and chemical data from aquifer D (considered the best flow zone), the flow zone was isolated by packers and fit with pressure transducers to obtain the desired data. The report also proposes a tracer test in aquifer D to look at movement of wastes. MTR-ETR: Jones observed that aqueous radioactive and chemical wastes discharged to an infiltration pond located near the MTR-ETR area were identified in a perched water body of elliptical shape underlying the pond. The configuration of the perched water body, the head distribution, and the chemical characteristics of the perched water body are shown in figures 62–70. Jones also concluded that contaminants had not migrated to the Snake River Plain aquifer beneath the perched water body except for limited migration in the boreholes of aquifer wells. As a result of this discovery, the Halliburton method of grouting was employed to remedy the leakage problem in these wells.

## Nace1961

The first release of radioactive waste at the NRTS occurred in 1952 at the TRA. The USGS and Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) collected alpha-, beta-, and gamma activity data at the NRTS prior to waste disposal to establish background levels in the Snake River Plain aquifer. The USGS suspended collection in 1958 and the AEC continued collection. This report makes the philosophical observation that dangerous or potentially dangerous contamination of ground water can be avoided
>
1. by using waste-disposal methods that take advantage of favorable geologic, hydrologic, and geochemical factors that affect waste behavior in the ground, and
2. by controlling the amount and kind of waste released in accordance with the natural limitations in the environmental capacity to absorb contaminants.

The report also states the USGS’s non-advocacy of disposal of radioactive waste (p. 94). The purpose of the report is to examine waste management in relation to geologic and hydrologic facts and principles. The report summarizes knowledge gained in the early period of investigations, suggests ways to apply the information, and outlines some desirable additional studies.

The report presents the AEC principles governing waste disposal: waste management and disposal must be safe, and waste-disposal requirements and standards must be physically and economically feasible.

The report contains discussions of the classification of radioactivity levels in waste, the sources of waste at the NRTS, and the waste-management standards and practices. It also contains a discussion of the general situation and problems regarding waste disposal at the various facilities. Total disposals of radioactive waste (including the types and amounts of waste) for 1952–62 (tables 1–12) was discussed by facility. The natural physical, hydrologic, geochemical, and seismic factors affecting the feasibility of waste disposal at the NRTS were discussed in this report. The report also contains a discussion of the implications that natural factors have on the capacity of the ground to accept waste, on the recirculation of waste liquid, on ion exchange in sediments and rocks (table 13 gives cation exchange capacity (CEC) values for four fine grained and five coarse-grained samples), on evaporation, on water velocity, and on the nature of ground-water flow (with consideration of mixing, and density and thermal effects). The report contains discussions of the hazards of storing high level liquid and calcined waste, and the practicality of shallow and deep ground disposal of liquid wastes and potential locations for waste disposal are discussed. Ground disposal of solid wastes also was considered. The report emphasizes the importance of land- and water-conservation in waste management, in controlling the waste composition, and in minimizing the waste volume as much as possible. The report also made suggestions regarding waste-management practices at the NRTS.

## Walker1960

This report provides specific capacity data and coefficients of transmissibility for aquifer tests conducted by the USGS at the NRTS in 1958 and the first half of 1959. Five wells were tested (FET Prod. #1 and #2, now CTF 1 and 2; EBR 2#1, now EBR II-1; Fire Sta. 2; and GCRE, now ARA 3). The raw data and graphical analyses are provided in tables and illustrations, and well-construction data is provided in table 1.

## NaceOthers1959

This report describes the hydrology and evaluates the water resources of the NRTS, sets these in a regional perspective, and forecasts conditions and effects in future years. It summarizes and synthesizes the work that is partially covered in previously published reports and introduces large amounts of new data and interpretations. Plates included in the report are important contributions to the INEEL knowledge base and include: well locations; water table contours, April 1953; water-table contours, October 1956; depth to water, April 1953; and chemical quality of ground water at the NRTS, 1955, before waste-disposal effects.

The report also contains: maximum and minimum instantaneous and mean annual discharge for the Big Lost River (BLR), 1947–55; discussions of BLR discharge in 1951 and 52 with a description of upstream flooding at Arco, the resultant increased flow at the NRTS, and the results of an infiltration rates study on the BLR channel, 1951–53; calculated BLR playa infiltration rates, 1952–53; a discussion of Little Lost River, Birch Creek, and local runoff characteristics at the NRTS and vicinity; a discussion of flood and erosion hazards and bed-erosion possibilities on the BLR; velocity-maximum depth-discharge relations for the BLR during the 1951–53 high-flow period; surface water chemistry data for the BLR; a detailed description of the occurrence of ground water at the NRTS including depth to water, configuration of the water table (with apparent changes between 1953 and 1956), underflow, perched water (both natural at USGS 7 and artificial at the MTR, now TRA), quasi-artesian character in places, and unexplained phenomena (head reversals at CFA); a discussion of the water-bearing properties of basalt including the types of openings, the pore-porewater content and porosity, infiltration and percolation rates (describes the relation of BLR flow and the ground-water levels nearby in well MTR Test and 12 mi distant in well USGS 1), specific-capacity data (wells CFA-2, EBR 1, MTR- 1, -2, CCP-1, -2, -3, NRF-1, -2, USGS 12, 30, 31, ANP-1, -2, and average values for several counties located on the Snake River Plain), and various types of hydraulic tests at the ANP (now TAN) and CCP (now INTEC) areas (time-drawdown, distance-drawdown, and the generalized composite drawdown graphic method of Cooper and Jacobs (1946)); a discussion of the water-bearing properties of sediments including infiltration rates in gravel at the MTR and in the BLR channel, laboratory permeabilities of coarse-grained materials (table 15), and of fine-grained materials (table 17); a discussion of the groundwater hydrology including recharge (from precipitation, surface-water infiltration, and underflow from tributary valleys and the Mud Lake Basin), the amount of water in storage, the nature of ground-water movement (including rates, regional and local directions, and the amount of underflow at the NRTS), potential ground-water development and the effects on the NRTS (estimates of irrigation pumpage on the Snake River Plain in 1955, table 18), and natural and artificial (pumping) discharge from the Snake River Plain aquifer system and where it occurs; a discussion of the fluctuations of the water table at the NRTS including those with no associated change in ground-water storage such as seismic, wind, and barometric changes and those with an associated change in storage such as local recharge from infiltration of BLR water, seasonal variations in recharge or withdrawals, and changes due to long-term trends caused by pumping, irrigation diversions and returns, regional variations in weather patterns, or from changes in the regional surface-water regimens; and a discussion of the chemical quality of ground water at the NRTS including the following observations:

A. that water shallower than 1,200 ft is relatively uniform in chemical composition except for some minor depth and areal variations,
B. that this generally holds true both at the NRTS and across the SRPA (table 24 gives a summary of maximum, minimum, and mean concentrations for wells at the NRTS and the central SRPA),
C. that beta-gamma activity and sodium can be used as indicators of contamination but that none has been discovered by the Atomic Energy Commission to date,
D. that the unweathered nature of the basalt implies that very little dissolution is occurring,
E. that the water is predominantly calcium plus magnesium bicarbonate in character,
F. that increases in calcium and chloride concentrations above background concentrations often reflect the concentration effects of evaporation on irrigation return flow,
G. that deep water from well USGS 15 is significantly different from other nearby shallow SRPA water and that the difference probably is due to upwelling of water from depth (see p. 247),
H. that higher water temperatures of water from wells along the edges of the SRP probably reflect geothermal water moving up along mountain border faults,
I. that beta-gamma activity due to background sources is small and therefore likely to be a good indicator of contamination resulting from waste disposal,
J. that the small dissolved solids load of water in the SRPA results from the low solubility of basalt minerals and the relatively large ground-water velocities in the aquifer, which result in a shorter residence time with less opportunity for the water to dissolve the minerals, and
K. that the chemistry of the ground water at the NRTS is dominated by the mixing of waters from the tributary valleys with water from other sources such as the Mud Lake Basin.
L. At the time this report was written, all activities at the NRTS had been of a characterization nature. In the last sentence of this report, the author indirectly references a new phase of USGS activities that was about to be initiated at the NRTS—that of monitoring water quality with the intent of detecting and tracking ground-water contamination.

## Peckham1959

This report is important because it describes the first USGS monitoring to define and track waste plumes. Drilling contracts were awarded for 15 monitoring wells (USGS 34–48) to define the sodium-chloride (Na-Cl) plume and any detectable radioactive constituents emanating from the ICPP injection well. The contracts were as follows: 1954 (USGS 34), 1955 (USGS 35–39), 1956 (USGS 40–43), and 1957 (USGS 44–48). Conclusions based on the drilling and monitoring program were that the plume was broader than expected, that local flow-direction reversal occurred as a result of head buildup at the injection well, and that flow and contaminant migration occurred as a result of water movement along preferential pathways associated with basalt structure (including interflow zones, fracture patterns, and the presence of sedimentary interbeds). Table 1 gives records of wells in the ICPP area, and table 2 gives maximum Cl concentrations in water from wells USGS 34–48. Some additional observations stated directly for the first time were that:

1. waste had been disposed to the injection well (perforated 40 ft above and 100 ft below the water table), to two shallow, open-bottom manholes, and to an open infiltration basin (sewage);
2. the complex waste contained an average Cl concentration of about 250 mg/L;
3. normal (background?) Cl concentration was about 10 mg/L;
4. seepage from the Big Lost River caused local variations in the configuration of the water table and the direction of local ground-water movement;
5. higher ground-water temperature was correlated with increased concentrations of chloride;
6. temperature and chloride concentrations varied with depth; and
7. fault and fissure-eruption zones may act as hydraulic boundaries, particularly in the CPP (now INTEC) area.

## Nace1956

This report summarizes the purpose, history, and scope of early U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) investigations at the NRTS, and gives a brief history of the area during World War II when it was a Navy gunnery range and an Air Force bombing range. The report describes early USGS reconnaissance work in the area, the selection of the Pocatello area as the location of the NRTS, and the original work elements and funding agreements for USGS studies at the NRTS. The report gives the status and history of reactor/facility construction and development for EBR, MTR, ETR, STR (S1W), LSR (A1W), ANP and IET, SPERT, OMRE, CPP, CFA, BG (RWMC), and BORAX I, II, and III (the Experimental Boiling-Water Reactors).

The report describes in detail the basic investigations at the NRTS, which included: geologic mapping; test drilling (this section gives a comprehensive description of the timing, purpose, and cost of drilling wells USGS 1–40 and the facility-production wells drilled up to that point in time); geophysical exploration; a canvass of wells and water levels (see p. 29 for a description of the logic behind the location and timing of water-level measurements); spirit leveling; surface water investigations; chemical and radiometric analyses; hydrology of the basalt; amount of water available in the aquifer; construction of wells and the effects of pumping; and laboratory analytical work.

The report also briefly summarizes the research investigations at the NRTS, which included studies on the permeability of geologic materials, infiltration and percolation rates, hydraulics of basalt aquifers, ion exchange, and equipotential surveying (a proposal originated by Herb Shbitzke to introduce salt into a borehole and monitor its migration in the aquifer is included in this section).

The report also discusses coordination with other USGS studies on the Snake River Plain (which is a precursor to the USGS’s cooperative-funding program), emphasizes access to the expertise of the USGS’s National Program (which is a precursor to the USGS’s National Research Program), lists professional meetings attended by the USGS staff and reports published through 1955, gives a summary listing of USGS personnel, their tasks, and time of service at the NRTS (table 3), and provides a map showing the locations and types of studies conducted by the USGS at the NRTS (plate 1).

## Nace1955

This report makes some predictions about drawdown and transmissivities in the basalt aquifer. The assumption (first advanced in a general sense by C.V. Theis) that flow in the fractured Snake River Plain basaltic aquifer can be approximated on a regional scale by the mathematics of flow in a homogeneous and isotropic medium was first presented for the NRTS in this report. Specific recommendations were made for the three sites as follows:

MTR (now TRA) site.—That one new well with a 4,000 gpm pump be constructed 100 ft east of well MTR 1 (now TRA 1); that the capacity of MTR 1 be increased to 3,000 gpm by installing a new pump; that contingency plans be made for installing an additional well if the other two wells did not provide an adequate supply, including standby requirements; and that if a second new well was required, it would be constructed so as to eliminate the need for MTR 1.

STR (now NRF) site.—That the capacity of wells STR 1 and 2 (now NRF 1 and 2) be increased to 2,000 gpm or more by installing new pumps; that a new well with a capacity of 4,000 gpm or more be drilled between STR 1 and 2; and that provision be made for the drilling of a second new well if the execution of the previous recommendations did not provide an adequate supply, including a standby supply.

OMRE site.—That one well be constructed to supply the site giving consideration to the specific hydraulic predictions included in the report.

## DeutschOthers1952a

This report presents more formally the information contained in IDO–22021–USGS and provides more detailed responses to the questions posed in that report. Many of the 1952 responses reflect 1998 scientific thought on those questions, notably, the prediction of local variation of the hydraulic gradient relative to the regional gradient, preferred groundwater flowpaths in the vicinity of the ANPR (now TAN), and different water chemistry for wells at the ANPR. This report presents (1) lithologic logs of wells USGS 7, 24, 25, and 26; water-chemistry data for wells USGS 4, 7, 18, 21, 24, 25, 26, and 2nd Owsley (including conditions during water-sample collection and a listing of maximums and minimums for 30 samples from these wells); (2) grain-size analyses for seven surficial samples from the ANPR area; and (3) water-level data for wells USGS 24, 25, and 26 (see p. 13). The report identifies Birch Creek and Mud Lake underflow as the major source of recharge in the ANPR area; notes that the hydraulic gradient is flat in some places but changes as much as 10 ft/mi in other places, and that the regional flow direction is generally south to southwest although local flow directions change from southeast to southwest; contains a potentiometric map for October 1, 1952; makes predictions regarding the effects of waste disposal using new estimates of future waste quantity and type, and the direction of waste movement and effects on offsite users; and recommends locations for various disposal options. The report also predicts that ground-water chemistry will vary with depth (with water less than 400 ft deep being a Ca-CO<sub>3</sub> character, being moderately hard to hard, having a pH between 7.0 and 8.0, having a temperature of about 55 °F, and containing trace amounts of B and Mn). The report has a fence diagram showing the local stratigraphy of the ANPR site.

## DeutschOthers1952b

This report indicates that the Big Lost River began to contribute water to playas in 1951 and that they remained ponded through 1952, presents grain-size information for several types of deposits in the northeastern corner of the NRTS, indicates that sources of ground water in the northeastern corner are underflow from Birch Creek and Mud Lake and local precipitation, and that perched water located in several wells was attributed to recharge from precipitation. The report also gives drawdown measurements for several wells, presents chemical data and driller’s reports for 12 wells, and gives structural and engineering controls on materials (such as, stability, weather conditions, difficulties in drilling in materials, and how liquid waste disposal might be affected by the lithology) where proposed buildings were to be put.

## Nace1952b

This report provides a statement of water-supply needs and estimates of waste-disposal volumes at the ANPR site (now TAN) (mouth of Birch Creek Valley). It provides a summary of the basic problems that needed to be solved prior to development: (1) the adequacy of the ground-water reservoir to supply projected needs; (2) knowledge about the hydraulic gradient, and the direction and velocity of underflow; (3) the desirable locations, construction characteristics, and spacing of production wells (at ANPR and other sites); (4) the depth to water, drawdown, and lift in wells of specified capacity; (5) the general water quality; (6) the feasible types of fluid-waste-disposal facilities; and (7) the locations of waste-disposal facilities and required space relations relative to other ANPR and off- ANPR facilities. The report provided detailed responses to answer these questions, and many of the answers reflect 1998 scientific thought on these questions, notably, the prediction of local variation of the hydraulic gradient relative to the regional gradient, the preferred ground-water flowpaths in the vicinity of the site, and the anomalous water chemistry between wells at the site. This report presents a lithologic log of USGS 24 and temperature data for wells USGS 24 and USGS 7.
