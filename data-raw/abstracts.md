The R package inlpubs may be used to search and analyze 363 publications that cover the 73-year history of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Idaho Water Science Center, Idaho National Laboratory Project Office (INLPO). The INLPO publications were authored by 251 researchers trying to better understand the effects of waste disposal on water contained in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer and the availability of water for long-term consumptive and industrial use. Information contained within these publications is crucial to the management and use of the aquifer by the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) and the State of Idaho. USGS geohydrologic studies and monitoring, which began in 1949, were done in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy Idaho Operations Office (Bartholomay, 2017).

Radiochemical and chemical wastewater discharged to infiltration ponds and disposal wells since the early 1950s at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL), southeastern Idaho, has affected the water quality of the eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP) aquifer. In 2005, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, added a multilevel well-monitoring network to their ongoing monitoring program to begin describing the vertical movement and distribution of the chemical constituents in the ESRP aquifer.

Multilevel monitoring system (MLMS) monitoring at the INL has been ongoing since 2006, and this report summarizes data collected during 2014–18 from 11 multilevel monitoring wells. Hydraulic head (head) and groundwater temperature data were collected, including 177 measurements from hydraulically isolated depth intervals from 448.0 to 1,377.6 feet below land surface. One port (port 3) within well USGS 134 was not monitored owing to a valve failure.

Vertical head and temperature changes were quantified for each of the 11 multilevel monitoring systems. Fractured basalt zones generally had relatively small vertical head differences and showed a higher occurrence within volcanic rift zones. Poor connectivity between fractures and higher vertical gradients generally were attributed to sediment layers and (or) layers of dense basalt. Hydraulic head ranged from 4,415.5 to 4,462.6 feet above the North American Vertical Datum of 1988; groundwater temperature ranged from 10.4 to 16.8 degrees Celsius.

Normalized mean head values were analyzed for all 11 multilevel monitoring wells for the period of record (2007–18). The mean head values suggest a moderately positive correlation among all MLMS wells and generally reflect regional fluctuations in water levels in response to seasonal climatic changes. MLMS wells within volcanic rift zones and near the southern boundary indicate a temporal correlation that is strongly positive. MLMS wells in the Big Lost Trough indicate some variations in temporal correlations that may result from proximity to the mountain front to the northwest and episodic flow in the Big Lost River drainage system.

During 2014–18, water samples were collected from one to four discrete sampling zones, isolated by packers, in the upper 250–750 feet of the aquifer from 11 multilevel monitoring wells and were analyzed for selected radionuclides, inorganic constituents, organic constituents, and nutrients. Some additional samples were collected for volatile organic compounds from wells near the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC).

Nine quality-control replicate samples, three field blanks, and two equipment blanks were collected during 2014–18 as a measure of quality assurance. Concentrations of major ions and chromium in equipment blank samples were near or less than the reporting levels, suggesting no background contamination from field equipment or source water. About 88 percent of the replicate pairs for radionuclide results were statistically comparable and 100 percent of the replicate pairs for inorganic and organic compounds were statistically comparable.

Concentrations in wells USGS 105 and 132 mostly were greater than the reporting levels, and concentrations were mostly consistent. Wells USGS 103, USGS 131, and MIDDLE 2051 had concentrations mostly greater than the reporting 2 Multilevel Groundwater Monitoring, Eastern Snake River Plain Aquifer, Idaho National Laboratory, Idaho, 2014–18 level and showed decreasing concentrations. The decreasing concentrations are attributed to discontinued disposal, radioactive decay, and dilution and dispersion in the aquifer.

The volatile organic compound tetrachloromethane was found in all zones sampled in well USGS 132 near the RWMC and was found in two zones in well USGS 137A. Concentrations are attributed to waste disposal at the RWMC. Questionable detections of tetrachloroethene were found in well MIDDLE 2051; the source probably was tubing fluid in the well. Tetrachloroethene was found in the tubing fluid at elevated concentrations in three wells (USGS 137A, MIDDLE 2050A, and MIDDLE 2051), and remedial efforts to remove the elevated concentrations of tetrachloroethene from tubing fluid have been successful in each of the three MLMS wells.

In 2019, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, drilled and constructed boreholes USGS 148A and USGS 149 for stratigraphic framework analyses and long-term groundwater monitoring of the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) in southeastern Idaho. Initially, boreholes USGS 148A and USGS 149 were continuously cored to allow the USGS and INL subcontractor to collect select geophysical and seismic data and evaluate properties of recovered core material. The USGS geophysical data and descriptions of core material are described in this report; however, data collected by the INL contractor, including seismic data, are not included as part of the report.
The unsaturated zone at both borehole locations is relatively thick, depth to water was measured at approximately 663.6 feet (ft) below land surface (BLS) in USGS 148A, and at approximately 654.1 ft BLS at USGS 149. On completion of coring and data collection, both boreholes (USGS 148A and USGS 149) were repurposed as monitoring wells. Well USGS 148A was constructed to a depth of 759 ft BLS and instrumented with a dedicated submersible pump and measurement line; well USGS 149 was constructed to a depth of 974 ft BLS and instrumented with a multilevel monitoring system (WestbayTM).

Geophysical data, collected by the USGS, were used to characterize the subsurface geology and aquifer conditions. Natural gamma log measurements were used to assess sediment-layer thickness and location. Neutron and gamma-gamma source logs were used to confirm fractured and vesicular basalt identified for aquifer testing and multilevel monitoring well zone testing. Acoustic televiewer logs, collected for well USGS 149, were used to identify fractures and assess groundwater movement when compared with neutron measurements. Furthermore, gyroscopic deviation measurements were used to measure horizontal and vertical displacement for the constructed boreholes USGS 148A and USGS 149.
A single-well aquifer test was done in well USGS 148A during November 6–7, 2019, to provide estimates of transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity. Estimates for transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity were 6.34×103 feet squared per day and 3.17 feet per day, respectively. The aquifer test was run overnight (21.3 hours) and measured drawdown was relatively small (0.09 ft) at sustained pumping rates ranging from 15.7 to 16.1 gallons per minute. The transmissivity estimates for well USGS 148A were slightly lower than those determined from previous aquifer tests for wells near the Materials and Fuels Complex, but well within range of other aquifer tests done at the INL.

Water-quality samples, collected from well USGS 148A and from four zones in well USGS 149, were analyzed for cations, anions, metals, nutrients, volatile organic compounds, stable isotopes, and radionuclides. Water samples for most of the inorganic constituents showed similar chemistry in USGS 148A and all four zones in USGS 149. Water samples for stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen indicated some possible influence of irrigation on the water quality. Nitrate plus nitrite concentrations indicated influence from anthropogenic sources. The volatile organic compound and radiochemical data indicated that wastewater disposal practices at the Materials and Fuels Complex or from drilling had no detectable influence on these wells.

Water-quality activities and water-level measurements conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Project Office coincide with the USGS mission of appraising the quantity and quality of the Nation’s water resources. The activities are conducted in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Idaho Operations Office. Results of water-quality and hydraulic head investigations are presented in various USGS publications or in refereed scientific journals, and the data are stored in the National Water Information System (NWIS) database. The results of the studies are used by researchers, regulatory and managerial agencies, and civic groups.

In its broadest sense, “quality assurance” refers to doing the job right the first time. It includes the functions of planning for products, review and acceptance of the products, and an audit designed to evaluate the system that produces the products. Quality control and quality assurance differ in that quality control ensures that things are done correctly given the “state-of-the-art” technology, and quality assurance ensures that quality control is maintained within specified limits.

The establishment of an efficient aquifer water-quality aquifer monitoring network is a critical component in the assessment and protection of groundwater quality. A periodic evaluation of the monitoring network is mandatory to ensure effective data collection and possible redesigning of existing network. This package assesses the efficacy and appropriateness of an existing water-quality aquifer monitoring network in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer, Idaho.

## FisherOthers2021

Long-term monitoring of water-quality data collected from wells at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) have provided essential information for delineating the movement of radiochemical and chemical wastes in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer, southeastern Idaho. Since 1949, the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, has maintained as many as 200 wells in the INL water-quality monitoring network. A network design tool, distributed as an R package, was developed to evaluate and optimize groundwater monitoring in the existing network based on water-quality data collected at 153 sampling sites since January 1, 1989. The objective of the optimization design tool is to reduce well monitoring redundancy while retaining sufficient data to reliably characterize water-quality conditions in the aquifer. A spatial optimization was used to identify a set of wells whose removal leads to the smallest increase in the deviation between interpolated concentration maps using the existing and reduced monitoring networks while preserving significant long-term trends and seasonal components in the data. Additionally, a temporal optimization was used to identify reductions in sampling frequencies by minimizing the redundancy in sampling events.

Spatial optimization uses an islands genetic algorithm to identify near-optimal network designs removing 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 wells from the existing monitoring network. With this method, choosing a greater number of wells to remove results in greater cost savings and decreased accuracy of the average relative difference between interpolated maps of the reduced-dataset and the full-dataset. The genetic search algorithm identified reduced networks that best capture the spatial patterns of the average concentration plume while preserving long-term temporal trends at individual wells. Concentration data for 10 analyte types are integrated in a single optimization so that all datasets may be evaluated simultaneously. A constituent was selected for inclusion in the spatial optimization problem when the observations were sufficient to (1) establish a two-range variability model, (2) classify at least one concentration time series as a continuous record block, and (3) make a prediction using the quantile-kriging interpolation method. The selected constituents include sodium, chloride, sulfate, nitrate, carbon tetrachloride, 1,1-dichloroethylene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, trichloroethylene, tritium, strontium-90, and plutonium-238.

In temporal optimization, an iterative-thinning method was used to find an optimal sampling frequency for each analyte-well pair. Optimal frequencies indicate that for many of the wells, samples may be collected less frequently and still be able to characterize the concentration over time. The optimization results indicated that the sample-collection interval may be increased by an of average of 273 days owing to temporal redundancy.

The R package inldata is a collection of datasets for the U.S. Geological Survey-Idaho National Laboratory aquifer monitoring networks administrated by the Idaho National Laboratory Project Office in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy. Data collected from wells at the Idaho National Laboratory have been used to describe the effects of waste disposal on water contained in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer, located in the southeastern part of Idaho, and the availability of water for long-term consumptive and industrial use. Included in this package are the long-term monitoring records, dating back to measurements from 1949, and the geospatial data describing the areas from which samples were collected or observations were made. Bundling this data into a single R package significantly reduces the magnitude of data processing for researches. And provides a way to distribute the data along with its documentation in a standard format. Geospatial datasets are made available in a common projection and datum, and geohydrologic data have been structured to facilitate analysis. A list of all datasets in the package is given below.

The eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP) is a northeast-trending topographic basin interpreted to be the result of the time-transgressive track of the North American plate above the Yellowstone hotspot. The track is defined by the age progression of silicic volcanic rocks exposed along the margins of the ESRP. However, the bulk of these silicic rocks are buried under 1 to 3 kilometers of younger basalts. Here, silicic volcanic rocks recovered from boreholes that penetrate below the basalts, including INEL-1, WO-2 and new deep borehole USGS-142, are correlated with one another and to surface exposures to assess various models for ESRP subsidence. These correlations are established on U/Pb zircon and <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar sanidine age determinations, phenocryst assemblages, major and trace element geochemistry, δ<sup>18</sup>O isotopic data from selected phenocrysts, and initial εHf values of zircon. These data suggest a correlation of: (1) the newly documented 8.1±0.2 Ma rhyolite of Butte Quarry (sample 17KS03), exposed near Arco, Idaho to the upper-most Picabo volcanic field rhyolites found in borehole INEL-1; (2) the 6.73±0.02 Ma East Arco Hills rhyolite (sample 16KS02) to the Blacktail Creek Tuff, which was also encountered at the bottom of borehole WO-2; and (3) the 6.42±0.07 Ma rhyolite of borehole USGS-142 to the Walcott Tuff B encountered in deep borehole WO-2. These results show that rhyolites found along the western margin of the ESRP dip ~20° south-southeast toward the basin axis, and then gradually tilt less steeply in the subsurface as the axis is approached. This subsurface pattern of tilting is consistent with a previously proposed crustal flexural model of subsidence based only on surface exposures, but is inconsistent with subsidence models that require accommodation of ESRP subsidence on either a major normal fault or strike-slip fault.

Since 1952, wastewater discharged to infiltration ponds (also called percolation ponds) and disposal wells at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has affected water quality in the eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP) aquifer and perched groundwater zones underlying the INL. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, maintains groundwater-monitoring networks at the INL to determine hydrologic trends and to delineate the movement of radiochemical and chemical wastes in the aquifer and in perched groundwater zones. This report presents an analysis of water-level and water-quality data collected from the ESRP aquifer and perched groundwater wells in the USGS groundwater monitoring networks during 2016–18.

From March–May 2015 to March–May 2018, water levels in wells completed in the ESRP aquifer declined in the northern part of the INL and increased in the southwestern part. Water-level decreases ranged from 0.5 to 3.0 feet (ft) in the northern part of the INL and increases ranged from 0.5 to 3.0 ft in the southwestern part.

Detectable concentrations of radiochemical constituents in water samples from wells in the ESRP aquifer at the INL generally decreased or remained constant during 2016–18. Decreases in concentrations were attributed to radioactive decay, changes in waste-disposal methods, and dilution from recharge and underflow.

In 2018, concentrations of tritium in water samples collected from 46 of 111 aquifer wells were greater than the reporting level of three times the sample standard deviation and ranged from 260±50 to 5,100±190 picocuries per liter (pCi/L). Tritium concentrations in water from 10 wells completed in deep perched groundwater above the ESRP aquifer near the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) Complex generally were greater than or equal to the reporting level during at least one sampling event during 2016–18, and concentrations ranged from 150 ±50 to 12,900 ±200 pCi/L.

Concentrations of strontium-90 in water from 17 of 60 ESRP aquifer wells sampled during April or October 2018 exceeded the reporting level, ranging from 2.2±0.7 to 363±19 pCi/L. Strontium-90 was not detected in the ESRP aquifer beneath the ATR Complex. During at least one sampling event during 2016–18, concentrations of strontium-90 in water from eight wells completed in deep perched groundwater above the ESRP aquifer at the ATR Complex equaled or exceeded the reporting levels, and concentrations ranged from 0.57±0.17 to 34.3±1.2 pCi/L.

During 2016–18, concentrations of cesium-137 were less than the reporting level in all but one ESRP aquifer well, and concentrations of plutonium-238, -239, and -240 (undivided), and americium-241 were less than the reporting level in water samples from all ESRP aquifer wells.

In April 2009, the dissolved chromium concentration in water from one ESRP aquifer well, USGS 65, south of the ATR Complex equaled the maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 100 micrograms per liter (µg/L). In April 2018, the concentration of chromium in water from that well had decreased to 76.0 µg/L, less than the MCL. Concentrations in water samples from 62 other ESRP aquifer wells sampled ranged from less than 0.6 to 21.6 µg/L. During 2016–18, dissolved chromium was detected in water from all wells completed in deep perched groundwater above the ESRP aquifer at the ATR Complex, and concentrations ranged from 4.2 to 98.8 µg/L.

In 2018, concentrations of sodium in water from most ESRP aquifer wells in the southern part of the INL were greater than the western tributary background concentration of 8.3 milligrams per liter (mg/L). After the new percolation ponds were put into service in 2002 southwest of the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC), concentrations of sodium in water samples from the Rifle Range well increased steadily until 2008, when concentrations generally began decreasing. The increases and decreases were attributed to disposal variability in the new percolation ponds. During 2016–18, dissolved sodium concentrations in water from 18 wells completed in deep perched groundwater above the ESRP aquifer at the ATR Complex ranged from 6.37 to 143 mg/L.

In 2018, concentrations of chloride in most water samples from ESRP aquifer wells south of the INTEC and at the Central Facilities Area exceeded the background concentrations. Chloride concentrations in water from wells south of the INTEC generally have decreased since 2002 when chloride disposal to the old percolation ponds was discontinued. After the new percolation ponds southwest of the INTEC were put into service in 2002, concentrations of chloride in water samples from one well rose steadily until 2008 then began decreasing. During 2016–18, dissolved chloride concentrations in deep perched groundwater above the ESRP aquifer from 18 wells at the ATR Complex ranged from 3.89 to 176 mg/L.

In 2018, sulfate concentrations in water samples from ESRP aquifer wells in the south-central part of the INL exceeded the background concentration of sulfate and ranged from 22 to 151 mg/L. The greater-than-background concentrations in water from these wells probably resulted from sulfate disposal at the ATR Complex infiltration ponds or the old INTEC percolation ponds. In 2018, sulfate concentrations in water samples from wells near the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC) mostly were greater than background concentrations and could have resulted from well construction techniques and (or) waste disposal at the RWMC or the ATR complex. The maximum dissolved sulfate concentration in shallow perched groundwater above the ESRP aquifer near the ATR Complex was 215 mg/L in well CWP 3 in April 2016. During 2018, dissolved sulfate concentrations in water from wells completed in deep perched groundwater above the ESRP aquifer near the cold-waste ponds at the ATR Complex ranged from 65.8 to 171 mg/L.

In 2018, concentrations of nitrate in water from most ESRP aquifer wells at and near the INTEC exceeded the western tributary background concentration of 0.655 mg/L. Concentrations of nitrate in wells southwest of the INTEC and farther away from the influence of disposal areas and the Big Lost River show a general decrease in nitrate concentration through time. Two wells south of the INTEC show increasing trends that could be the result of wastewater beneath the INTEC tank farm being mobilized to the aquifer.

During 2016–18, water samples from several ESRP aquifer wells were collected and analyzed for volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Sixteen VOCs were detected. At least 1 and as many as 7 VOCs were detected in water samples from 15 wells. The primary VOCs detected include carbon tetrachloride, trichloromethane, tetrachloroethene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, and trichloroethene. In 2016–18, concentrations for all VOCs were less than their respective MCLs for drinking water, except carbon tetrachloride in water from two wells and trichloroethene in one well.

During 2016–18, variability and bias were evaluated from 37 replicate and 15 blank quality-assurance samples. Results from replicate analyses were investigated to evaluate sample variability. Constituents with acceptable reproducibility were major ions, trace elements, nutrients, and VOCs. All radiochemical constituents had acceptable reproducibility except for gross alpha- and beta-particle radioactivity. The gross alpha- and beta-particle radioactivity samples that did not meet reproducibility criteria had low concentrations. Bias from sample contamination was evaluated from equipment, field, and source-solution blanks. Cadmium had a concentration slightly greater than its reporting level in a source-solution blank, and chloride and ammonia had concentrations that were slightly greater than their respective reporting levels in field and equipment blanks. Subtracting concentrations of chloride and ammonia in field blanks from the concurrently collected equipment blank indicates that adjusted concentrations for chloride and ammonia in the equipment blanks were less than their respective reporting levels. Therefore, no sample bias was observed for any of the sample periods.

From 1953 to 1988, approximately 0.941 curies of iodine-129 (<sup>129</sup>I) were contained in wastewater generated at the Idaho National Laboratory, with almost all of it discharged at or near the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC). Until 1984, most of the wastewater was discharged directly into the eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP) aquifer through a deep disposal well; however, some wastewater was also discharged into unlined infiltration ponds or leaked from distribution systems below the INTEC.

During 2017–18, the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, collected samples for <sup>129</sup>I from 30 wells that monitor the ESRP aquifer to track concentrations and changes of the carcinogenic radionuclide that has a 15.7 million-year half-life. Concentrations of <sup>129</sup>I in the aquifer ranged from 0.000016±0.000001 to 0.88±0.03 picocuries per liter (pCi/L), and concentrations generally decreased in wells near the INTEC as compared with previously collected samples. The average concentration of 15 wells sampled during 5 different sample periods decreased from 1.15 pCi/L in 1990–91 to 0.168 pCi/L in 2017–18, but average concentrations were similar to 2011–12 within analytical uncertainty. All but four wells within a 3-mile radius of the INTEC showed decreases in concentration, and all samples had concentrations less than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s maximum contaminant level of 1 pCi/L. These decreases are attributed to the discontinuation of disposal of <sup>129</sup>I in wastewater and to dilution and dispersion in the aquifer. Some wells southeast of INTEC showed increasing trends; these increases were attributed to variable transmissivity.

Although wells near INTEC sampled in 2017–18 showed decreases in concentrations compared with data collected previously, some wells south of the INL boundary showed small increases. These increases are attributed to historical variable discharge rates of wastewater that eventually moved to these well locations as a pulse of water from a particular disposal period.

## Rattray2019

Nuclear research activities at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Idaho National Laboratory (INL) produced liquid and solid chemical and radiochemical wastes that were disposed to the subsurface resulting in detectable concentrations of some waste constituents in the eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP) aquifer. These waste constituents may affect the water quality of the aquifer and may pose risks to the eventual users of the aquifer water. To understand these risks to water quality the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the DOE, conducted geochemical mass-balance modeling of the ESRP aquifer to improve the understanding of chemical reactions, sources of recharge, mixing of water, and groundwater flow directions in the shallow (upper 250 feet) aquifer at the INL.

Modeling was conducted using the water chemistry of 127 water samples collected from sites at and near the INL. Water samples were collected between 1952 and 2017 with most of the samples collected during the mid-1990s. Geochemistry and isotopic data used in geochemical modeling consisted of dissolved oxygen, carbon dioxide, major ions, silica, aluminum, iron, and the stable isotope ratios of hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon.

Geochemical modeling results indicated that the primary chemical reactions in the aquifer were precipitation of calcite and dissolution of plagioclase (An60) and basalt volcanic glass. Secondary minerals other than calcite included calcium montmorillonite and goethite. Reverse cation exchange, consisting of sodium exchanging for calcium on clay minerals, occurred near site facilities where large amounts of sodium were released to the ESRP aquifer in wastewater discharge. Reverse cation exchange acted to retard the movement of wastewater-derived sodium in the aquifer.

Regional groundwater inflow was the primary source of recharge to the aquifer underlying the Northeast and Southeast INL Areas. Birch Creek (BC), the Big Lost River (BLR), and groundwater from BC valley provided recharge to the North INL Area, and the BLR and groundwater from BC and Little Lost River (LLR) valleys provided recharge to the Central INL Area. The BLR, groundwater from the BLR and LLR valleys and the Lost River Range, and precipitation provided recharge to the Northwest and Southwest INL Areas. The primary source of recharge west and southwest of the INL was groundwater inflow from BLR valley. Upwelling geothermal water was a small source of recharge at two wells. Aquifer recharge from surface water in the northern, central, and western parts of the INL indicated that the aquifer in these areas was a dynamic, open system, whereas the aquifer in the eastern part of the INL, which receives little recharge from surface water, was a relatively static and closed system.

Sources of recharge identified from isotope ratios and geochemical modeling (major ion concentrations) were nearly identical for the North, Northeast, Southeast, and Central INL Areas, which indicated that both methods probably accurately identified the sources of recharge in these areas. Conversely, isotope ratios indicated that the BLR and groundwater from the LLR valley provided most recharge to the western parts of the Northwest and Southwest INL Areas, whereas geochemical modeling results indicated a smaller area of recharge from the BLR and groundwater from the LLR valley, a larger area of recharge from the Lost River Range, and recharge of groundwater from the BLR valley that extended to the west INL boundary. The results from geochemical modeling probably were more accurate because major ion concentrations, but not isotope ratios, were available to characterize groundwater from the BLR valley and the Lost River Range.

Sources of recharge identified with a groundwater flow model (using particle tracking) and geochemical modeling were similar for the Northeast and Southeast INL Areas. However, differences between the models were that the geochemical model represented (1) recharge of groundwater from the Lost River Range in the western part of the INL, whereas the flow model did not, (2) recharge of groundwater from the BC and BLR valleys extending farther south and east, respectively, than the flow model, and (3) more recharge from the BLR in the Southwest INL Area than the flow model.

Mixing of aquifer water beneath the INL included (1) mixing of regional groundwater and water from the BC valley in the Northeast and Southeast INL Areas and (2) mixing of surface water (primarily from the BLR) and groundwater across much of the North, Central, Northwest, and Southwest INL Areas. Localized recharge from precipitation mixed with groundwater in the Northwest and Southwest INL Areas, and localized upwelling geothermal water mixed with groundwater in the Central and Northeast INL Areas. Flow directions of regional groundwater were south in the eastern part of the INL and south-southwest at downgradient locations. Groundwater from the BC and LLR valleys initially flowed southeast before changing to south-southwest flow directions that paralleled regional groundwater, and groundwater from the BLR valley initially flowed south before changing to a south-southwest direction.

Wastewater-contaminated groundwater flowed south from the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC) infiltration ponds in a narrow plume, with the percentage of wastewater in groundwater decreasing due to dilution, dispersion, and (or) degradation from about 60–80 percent wastewater 0.7–0.8 mile (mi) south of the INTEC infiltration ponds to about 1.4 percent wastewater about 15.5 mi south of the INTEC infiltration ponds. Wastewater-contaminated groundwater flowed southeast and then southwest from the Naval Reactors Facility industrial waste ditch, with the percentage of wastewater in groundwater decreasing from about 100 percent wastewater adjacent to the waste ditch to about 2 percent wastewater about 0.6 mi south of the waste ditch.

The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, conducted aquifer tests during 2017–18 on 101 wells at and near the Idaho National Laboratory (INL), Idaho, to define the hydraulic characteristics for individual wells. These were short-duration aquifer tests, conducted with a limited number of observations during routine sampling. Pumped intervals (water columns) for individual wells ranged from 12 to 790 feet (ft). Semi-constant discharge rates during aquifer testing ranged from 1 to 45 gallons per minute (gal/min), water-level response to pumping ranged from no observed drawdown to 52.4 ft, and length of aquifer tests for individual wells ranged from 10 to 160 minutes. Individual well data were analyzed to estimate the capacity of the well to produce water (specific capacity) and to estimate values for transmissivity. Estimates of specific capacity for individual wells ranged from less than (<) 1.0 to greater than (>) 3.0×10<sup>3</sup> gallons per minute per foot; estimates of transmissivity for individual wells ranged from 2.0 to >5.4×10<sup>5</sup> feet squared per day (ft<sup>2</sup>/d).

Geophysical log data, well construction information, and general geology for individual wells were presented and included in this report. Basic hydrogeologic features for individual wells were described, along with a composite of natural gamma, neutron, gamma-gamma dual density, and acoustic televiewer data (when available). The geophysical and geologic data were used to suggest the location and thickness of sediment layers along with fractured and dense basalt areas for individual wells. Geophysical data were used to describe the general geology where geologic descriptions and (or) driller notes were not available.

A simplified approach was used to complete aquifer testing for 101 individual wells during routine sampling. This approach involved using a dedicated submersible pump and a dedicated water-level measurement line to stress the well through pumping while simultaneously taking water-level measurements. Discharge rates were considered semi-constant and water levels were measured using an electric tape. These tests were done during routine sampling; therefore, the aquifer test data were limited to the time it took to purge the well before sampling activities. All 101 single-well aquifer tests were analyzed using the specific-capacity method to approximate transmissivity.

Review of well productivity included examination of aquifer test data for 65 wells collected during this investigation and previous investigations spanning about 30 years. Additionally, hydrograph data were presented for a similar period of record at four select well locations to provide a snapshot of the general water-level change along the north end of the INL, the center of the INL, and along the south end of the INL. Eleven of the 65 wells had a change in well productivity—six wells with increased productivity and five wells with decreased productivity. Hydrograph data suggest that water-level responses over a 30-year period can vary by almost 25 ft between the northern to southern end of the INL, with the largest water-level declines of about 35 ft at the northern end of the INL. Near the southern part of the INL, water-level declines were about 10 ft for that same 30-year period of record. Declines in water levels and changes in well conditions seemed to affect about 17 percent of individual wells; however, 83 percent of wells did not have any changes in well conditions. Observations of well conditions were based on the wells used for this study and do not represent wells that are no longer in service.

Estimates of transmissivity were divided into five categories, ranging from very low to very high. About 53 percent of the wells tested suggest high or very high transmissivity (>10,000 ft<sup>2</sup>/d), about 23 percent of the wells tested show low or very low (referred to as “lower”) transmissivity (≤1,000 ft<sup>2</sup>/d), and about 24 percent of wells tested suggest moderate transmissivity (>1,000 to 10,000 ft<sup>2</sup>/d). Transmissivity range(s) were developed for well data collected as part of this investigation.

Location of volcanic vent corridors along with dike systems under the subsurface were examined in conjunction with wells that indicate lower transmissivity (≤1,000 ft<sup>2</sup>/d) to develop inferred areas of lower transmissivity. The individual wells within the low and very low transmissivity category seem to correlate with select volcanic vent corridor areas identified in previous investigations. Based on data from 24 individual wells, eight inferred regions were identified that show low and very low transmissivity. The largest inferred area of lower transmissivity (≤1,000 ft<sup>2</sup>/d) seems to extend from the Lost River Range through the center of the INL and crosses the southern INL boundary near Atomic City. Seven other inferred regions of lower transmissivity (>1,000 ft<sup>2</sup>/d) are identified and occur along areas where volcanic vent corridors were previously identified.

In 1990, the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy Idaho Operations Office, established the Lithologic Core Storage Library at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL). The facility was established to consolidate, catalog, and permanently store nonradioactive drill cores and cuttings from subsurface investigations conducted at the INL, and to provide a location for researchers to examine, sample, and test these materials.

The facility is open by appointment to researchers for examination, sampling, and testing of cores and cuttings. This report describes the facility and cores and cuttings stored at the facility. Descriptions of cores and cuttings include the corehole names, corehole locations, and depth intervals available.

Most cores and cuttings stored at the facility were drilled at or near the INL, on the eastern Snake River Plain; however, two cores drilled on the western Snake River Plain are stored for comparative studies. Basalt, rhyolite, sedimentary interbeds, and surficial sediments compose most cores and cuttings, most of which are continuous from land surface to their total depth. The deepest continuously drilled core stored at the facility was drilled to 5,000 feet below land surface. This report describes procedures and researchers' responsibilities for access to the facility and for examination, sampling, and return of materials.

Nuclear research activities at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Idaho National Laboratory (INL) in eastern Idaho produced radiochemical and chemical wastes that were discharged to the subsurface, resulting in detectable concentrations of some waste constituents in the eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP) aquifer. These waste constituents may pose risks to the water quality of the aquifer. In order to understand these risks to water quality the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the DOE, conducted a study of groundwater geochemistry to improve the understanding of hydrologic and chemical processes in the ESRP aquifer at and near the INL and to understand how these processes affect waste constituents in the aquifer.

Geochemistry data were used to identify sources of recharge, mixing of water, and directions of groundwater flow in the ESRP aquifer at the INL. The geochemistry data were analyzed from 167 sample sites at and near the INL. The sites included 150 groundwater, 13 surface-water, and 4 geothermal-water sites. The data were collected between 1952 and 2012, although most data collected at the INL were collected from 1989 to 1996. Water samples were analyzed for all or most of the following: field parameters, dissolved gases, major ions, dissolved metals, isotope ratios, and environmental tracers.

Sources of recharge identified at the INL were regional groundwater, groundwater from the Little Lost River (LLR) and Birch Creek (BC) valleys, groundwater from the Lost River Range, geothermal water, and surface water from the Big Lost River (BLR), LLR, and BC. Recharge from the BLR that may have occurred during the last glacial epoch, or paleorecharge, may be present at several wells in the southwestern part of the INL. Mixing of water at the INL primarily included mixing of surface water with groundwater from the tributary valleys and mixing of geothermal water with regional groundwater. Additionally, a zone of mixing between tributary valley water and regional groundwater, trending southwesterly, extended from near the northeastern boundary of the INL to the southern boundary of the INL. Groundwater flow directions for regional groundwater were southwesterly, and flow directions for tributary groundwater were southeasterly upon entering the ESRP, but eventually began to flow southwesterly in a direction parallel with regional groundwater.

Several discrepancies were identified from comparison of sources of recharge determined from geochemistry data and backward particle tracking with a groundwater-flow model. Some discrepancies observed in the particle tracking results included representation of recharge from BC near the north INL boundary, groundwater from the BC valley not extending far enough south, regional groundwater that extends too far west in the southern part of the INL, and no representation of recharge from geothermal water in model layer 1 or recharge from the BLR in the southwestern part of the INL.

The eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP) aquifer is contained within the northeast trending volcanic province known as the ESRP. The majority of the ESRP aquifer flows through rubble zones between basalt layers. In the western Idaho National Laboratory (INL), the base of the ESRP aquifer is likely defined by the contact between subsurface Snake River-type rhyolites and overlying basalts. Near the western margin of the ESRP, basalts are thought to thin, and the subsurface geology and geometry of the basalt-rhyolite contact there are poorly constrained.

A recently drilled rhyolite in borehole USGS-142 is tentatively correlated to the Walcott Tuff B in borehole WO-2. Another rhyolite, exposed at the surface southeast of Arco, Idaho, dips 20° south toward the ESRP, and is tentatively correlated to the uppermost Picabo-aged rhyolite found in borehole INEL-1. These correlations suggest that the tilts of surface and subsurface rhyolites must shallow toward their correlative units from the margin to the center of the ESRP; the tilts of subsurface rhyolites are localized near the margin of the ESRP and northern Basin and Range.

This research also involved a kinematic analysis of northeast-striking, small-offset faults due east of Arco, Idaho as a basis for inferring the tectonic evolution of the western margin of the ESRP. Northeast-striking faults record nearly pure dip-slip offset and a northwest-southeast extension direction. In addition, faults proximal to the ESRP record a northwest-plunging extension direction, whereas faults distal to the ESRP record a shallowly southeast-plunging extension direction. These observations suggest that the northeast-striking faults likely formed as a result of early stages of flexure from the subsidence of the ESRP and were later rotated similarly to Mesozoic fold-hinges.

In 2017, the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, drilled and constructed borehole TAN-2312 for stratigraphic framework analyses and long-term groundwater monitoring of the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer at the Idaho National Laboratory in southeast Idaho. The location of borehole TAN-2312 was selected because it was downgradient from TAN and believed to be the outer extent of waste plumes originating from the TAN facility. Borehole TAN-2312 initially was cored to collect continuous geologic data, and then re-drilled to complete construction as a monitor well. The final construction for borehole TAN-2312 required 16- and 10-inch (in.) diameter carbon-steel well casing to 37 and 228 feet below land surface (ft BLS), respectively, and 9.9-in. diameter open-hole completion below the casing to 522 ft BLS. Depth to water is measured near 244 ft BLS. Following construction and data collection, a temporary submersible pump and water-level access line were placed near 340 ft BLS to allow for aquifer testing, for collecting periodic water samples, and for measuring water levels.

Borehole TAN-2312 was cored continuously, starting at the first basalt contact (about 37 ft BLS) to a depth of 568 ft BLS. Not including surface sediment (0–37 ft), recovery of basalt and sediment core at borehole TAN-2312 was about 93 percent; however, core recovery from 170 to 568 ft BLS was 100 percent. Based on visual inspection of core and geophysical data, basalt examined from 37 to 568 ft BLS consists of about 32 basalt flows that range from approximately 3 to 87 ft in thickness and 4 sediment layers with a combined thickness of approximately 76 ft. About 2 ft of total sediment was described for the saturated zone, observed from 244 to 568 ft BLS, near 296 and 481 ft BLS. Sediment described for the saturated zone were composed of fine-grained sand and silt with a lesser amount of clay. Basalt texture for borehole TAN-2312 generally was described as aphanitic, phaneritic, and porphyritic. Basalt flows varied from highly fractured to dense with high to low vesiculation.

Geophysical and borehole video logs were collected after core drilling and after final construction at borehole TAN-2312. Geophysical logs were examined synergistically with available core material to suggest zones where groundwater flow was anticipated. Natural gamma log measurements were used to assess sediment layer thickness and location. Neutron and gamma-gamma source logs were used to identify fractured areas for aquifer testing. Acoustic televiewer logs, fluid logs, and electromagnetic flow meter results were used to identify fractures and assess groundwater movement when compared against neutron measurements. Furthermore, gyroscopic deviation measurements were used to measure horizontal and vertical displacement for borehole TAN-2312.

After construction of borehole TAN-2312, a single-well aquifer test was completed September 27, 2017, to provide estimates of transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity. Estimates for transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity were 1.51×10<sup>2</sup> feet squared per day and 0.23 feet per day, respectively. During the 220-minute aquifer test, well TAN-2312 had about 23 ft of measured drawdown at sustained pumping rate of 27.2 gallons per minute. The transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity estimates for well TAN-2312 were lower than the values determined from previous aquifer tests in other wells near Test Area North.

Water samples were analyzed for cations, anions, metals, nutrients, volatile organic compounds, stable isotopes, and radionuclides. Water samples for most of the inorganic constituents showed concentrations near background levels for eastern regional groundwater. Water samples for stable isotopes of oxygen, hydrogen, and sulfur indicated some possible influence of irrigation on the water quality. The volatile organic compound data indicated that this well had some minor influence by wastewater disposal practices at Test Area North.

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geohydrologic studies and monitoring at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) is an ongoing, long-term program. This program, which began in 1949, includes hydrologic monitoring networks and investigative studies that describe the effects of waste disposal on water contained in the eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP) aquifer and the availability of water for long-term consumptive and industrial use. Interpretive reports documenting study findings are available to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and its contractors; other Federal, State, and local agencies; private firms; and the public at https://id.water.usgs.gov/INL/Pubs/index.html. Information contained within these reports is crucial to the management and use of the aquifer by the INL and the State of Idaho. USGS geohydrologic studies and monitoring are done in cooperation with the DOE Idaho Operations Office.

Wastewater discharged to wells and ponds and wastes buried in shallow pits and trenches at facilities at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) have contributed contaminants to the eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP) aquifer in the southwestern part of the INL. This report describes the correlation between subsurface stratigraphy in the southwestern part of the INL with information on the presence or absence of wastewater constituents to better understand how flow pathways in the aquifer control the movement of wastewater discharged at INL facilities. Paleomagnetic inclination was used to identify subsurface basalt flows based on similar inclination measurements, polarity, and stratigraphic position. Tritium concentrations, along with other chemical information for wells where tritium concentrations were lacking, were used as an indicator of which wells were influenced by wastewater disposal.

The basalt lava flows in the upper 150 feet of the ESRP aquifer where wastewater was discharged at the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC) consisted of the Central Facilities Area (CFA) Buried Vent flow and the AEC Butte flow. At the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) Complex, where wastewater would presumably pond on the surface of the water table, the CFA Buried Vent flow probably occurs as the primary stratigraphic unit present; however, AEC Butte flow also could be present at some of the locations. At the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC), where contamination from buried wastes would presumably move down through the unsaturated zone and pond on the surface of the water table, the CFA Buried Vent; Late Basal Brunhes; or Early Basal Brunhes basalt flows are the flow unit at or near the water table in different cores.

In the wells closer to where wastewater disposal occurred at INTEC and the ATR-Complex, almost all the wells show wastewater influence in the upper part of the ESRP aquifer and wastewater is present in both the CFA Buried Vent flow and AEC Butte flow. The CFA Buried Vent flow and AEC Butte flow are also present in wells at and north of CFA and are all influenced by wastewater contamination. All wells with the AEC Butte flow present have wastewater influence and 83 percent of the wells with the more prevalent CFA Buried Vent flow have wastewater influence. South and southeast of CFA, most wells are not influenced by wastewater disposal and are completed in the Big Lost Flow and the CFA Buried Vent flow. Wells southwest of CFA are influenced by wastewater disposal and are completed in the Big Lost flow and CFA Buried Vent flow at the top of the aquifer. Basalt stratigraphy indicates that the CFA Buried Vent flow is the predominant flow in the upper part of the ESRP aquifer at and near the RWMC as it is present in all the wells in this area. The Late Basal Brunhes flow, Middle Basal Brunhes flow, Early Basal Brunhes flow, South Late Matuyama flow, and Matuyama flow are also present in various wells influenced by waste disposal.

Some wells south of RWMC do not show wastewater influence, and the lack of wastewater influence could be due to low hydraulic conductivities. Several wells south and southeast of CFA also do not show wastewater influence. Low hydraulic conductivities or ESRP subsidence are possible causes for lack of wastewater south of CFA.

Multilevel monitoring wells completed much deeper in the aquifer show influence of wastewater in numerous basalt flows. Well Middle 2051 (northwest of RWMC) does not show wastewater influence in its upper three basalt flows (CFA Buried Vent, Late Basal Brunhes, and Middle Basal Brunhes); however, wastewater is present in two deeper flows (the Matuyama and Jaramillo flows). Well USGS 131A (southwest of CFA) and USGS132 (south of RWMC) both show wastewater influence in all the basalt flows sampled in the upper 600 feet of the aquifer. Wells USGS 137A, 105, 108, and 103 completed along the southern boundary of the INL all show wastewater influence in several basalt flows including the G flow, Middle and Early Basal Brunhes flows, the South Late Matuyama flow and the Matuyama flow; however, the strongest wastewater influence appears to be in the South Late Matuyama flow. The concentrations of wastewater constituents in deeper parts of these wells support the concept of groundwater flow deepening in the southwestern part of the INL.

Since 1952, wastewater discharged to infiltration ponds (also called percolation ponds) and disposal wells at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has affected water quality in the eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP) aquifer and perched groundwater zones underlying the INL. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, maintains groundwater-monitoring networks at the INL to determine hydrologic trends and to delineate the movement of radiochemical and chemical wastes in the aquifer and in perched groundwater zones. This report presents an analysis of water-level and water-quality data collected from the ESRP aquifer, multilevel monitoring system (MLMS) wells in the ESRP aquifer, and perched groundwater wells in the USGS groundwater monitoring networks during 2012-15.

Starting in 2014, the U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, drilled and constructed boreholes USGS 142 and USGS 142A for stratigraphic framework analyses and long-term groundwater monitoring of the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer at the Idaho National Laboratory in southeast Idaho. Borehole USGS 142 initially was cored to collect rock and sediment core, then re-drilled to complete construction as a screened water-level monitoring well. Borehole USGS 142A was drilled and constructed as a monitoring well after construction problems with borehole USGS 142 prevented access to upper 100 feet (ft) of the aquifer. Boreholes USGS 142 and USGS 142A are separated by about 30 ft and have similar geology and hydrologic characteristics. Groundwater was first measured near 530 feet below land surface (ft BLS) at both borehole locations. Water levels measured through piezometers, separated by almost 1,200 ft, in borehole USGS 142 indicate upward hydraulic gradients at this location. Following construction and data collection, screened water-level access lines were placed in boreholes USGS 142 and USGS 142A to allow for recurring water level measurements.

Borehole USGS 142 was cored continuously, starting at the first basalt contact (about 4.9 ft BLS) to a depth of 1,880 ft BLS. Excluding surface sediment, recovery of basalt, rhyolite, and sediment core at borehole USGS 142 was approximately 89 percent or 1,666 ft of total core recovered. Based on visual inspection of core and geophysical data, material examined from 4.9 to 1,880 ft BLS in borehole USGS 142 consists of approximately 45 basalt flows, 16 significant sediment and (or) sedimentary rock layers, and rhyolite welded tuff. Rhyolite was encountered at approximately 1,396 ft BLS. Sediment layers comprise a large percentage of the borehole between 739 and 1,396 ft BLS with grain sizes ranging from clay and silt to cobble size. Sedimentary rock layers had calcite cement. Basalt flows ranged in thickness from about 2 to 100 ft and varied from highly fractured to dense, and ranged from massive to diktytaxitic to scoriaceous, in texture.

Geophysical logs were collected on completion of drilling at boreholes USGS 142 and USGS 142A. Geophysical logs were examined with available core material to describe basalt, sediment and sedimentary rock layers, and rhyolite. Natural gamma logs were used to confirm sediment layer thickness and location; neutron logs were used to examine basalt flow units and changes in hydrogen content; gamma-gamma density logs were used to describe general changes in rock properties; and temperature logs were used to understand hydraulic gradients for deeper sections of borehole USGS 142. Gyroscopic deviation was measured to record deviation from true vertical at all depths in boreholes USGS 142 and USGS 142A.

The U.S. Geological Survey and Idaho Department of Environmental Quality Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Oversight Program in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy determined background concentrations of selected chemical and radiochemical constituents in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer to aid with ongoing cleanup efforts at the INL. Chemical and radiochemical constituents including calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, silica, chloride, sulfate, fluoride, bicarbonate, chromium, nitrate, tritium, strontium-90, chlorine-36, iodine-129, plutonium-238, plutonium-239, -240 (undivided), americium-241, technetium-99, uranium-234, uranium-235, and uranium-238 were selected for the background study because they were either not analyzed in earlier studies or new data became available to give a more recent determination of background concentrations. Samples of water collected from wells and springs at and near the INL that were not believed to be influenced by wastewater disposal were used to identify background concentrations. Groundwater in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer at and near the INL was divided into two major water types (western tributary and eastern regional) based on concentrations of lithium less than and greater than 5 micrograms per liter (μg/L). Median concentrations for each constituent were used to define the upper limit of background.

The upper limit of background concentrations for inorganic chemicals for western tributary water was 40.7 milligrams per liter (mg/L) for calcium, 15.3 mg/L for magnesium, 8.30 mg/L for sodium, 2.32 mg/L for potassium, 23.1 mg/L for silica, 11.8 mg/L for chloride, 21.4 mg/L for sulfate, 0.20 mg/L for fluoride, 176 mg/L for bicarbonate, 4.00 μg/L for chromium, and 0.655 mg/L for nitrate.

The upper limit of background concentrations for inorganic chemicals for eastern regional water was 34.05 mg/L for calcium, 13.85 mg/L for magnesium, 14.85 mg/L for sodium, 3.22 mg/L for potassium, 31.0 mg/L for silica, 14.15 mg/L for chloride, 20.2 mg/L for sulfate, 0.4675 mg/L for fluoride, 165 mg/L for bicarbonate, 3.00 μg/L for chromium, and 0.995 mg/L for nitrate.

The upper limit of background concentrations for radiochemical constituents for western tributary water was 34.15±2.35 picocuries per liter (pCi/L) for tritium, 0.00098±0.00006 pCi/L for chlorine-36, 0.000011±0.000005 pCi/L for iodine-129, <0.0000054 pCi/L for technetium-99, 0 pCi/L for strontium-90, plutonium-238, plutonium-239, -240 (undivided), and americium-241, 1.36 pCi/L with undetermined uncertainty for uranium-234, 0.025±0.001 pCi/L for uranium-235, and 0.541±0.001 pCi/L for uranium-238.

The upper limit of background concentrations for radiochemical constituents for eastern regional water was 5.43±0.574 pCi/L for tritium, 0.0002048±0.0000054 pCi/L for chlorine-36, 0.000000865±0.000000015 pCi/L for iodine-129, <0.0000054 pCi/L for technetium-99, 0 pCi/L for strontium-90, plutonium-238, plutonium-239, -240 (undivided), and americium-241, 1.32±0.77 pCi/L for uranium-234, 0.016±0.012 pCi/L for uranium-235, and 0.477±0.044 pCi/L for uranium-238.

## HodgesChampion2016

The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, used paleomagnetic data from 18 coreholes to construct three cross sections of subsurface basalt flows in the southern part of the Idaho National Laboratory (INL). These cross sections, containing descriptions of the subsurface horizontal and vertical distribution of basalt flows and sediment layers, will be used in geological studies, and to construct numerical models of groundwater flow and contaminant transport.

Subsurface cross sections were used to correlate surface vents to their subsurface flows intersected by coreholes, to correlate subsurface flows between coreholes, and to identify possible subsurface vent locations of subsurface flows. Correlations were identified by average paleomagnetic inclinations of flows, and depth from land surface in coreholes, normalized to the North American Datum of 1927. Paleomagnetic data were combined, in some cases, with other data, such as radiometric ages of flows. Possible vent locations of buried basalt flows were identified by determining the location of the maximum thickness of flows penetrated by more than one corehole.

Flows from the surface volcanic vents Quaking Aspen Butte, Vent 5206, Mid Butte, Lavatoo Butte, Crater Butte, Pond Butte, Vent 5350, Vent 5252, Tin Cup Butte, Vent 4959, Vent 5119, and AEC Butte are found in coreholes, and were correlated to the surface vents by matching their paleomagnetic inclinations, and in some cases, their stratigraphic positions.

Some subsurface basalt flows that do not correlate to surface vents, do correlate over several coreholes, and may correlate to buried vents. Subsurface flows which correlate across several coreholes, but not to a surface vent include the D3 flow, the Big Lost flow, the CFA buried vent flow, the Early, Middle, and Late Basal Brunhes flows, the South Late Matuyama flow, the Matuyama flow, and the Jaramillo flow. The location of vents buried in the subsurface by younger basalt flows can be inferred if their flows are penetrated by several coreholes, by tracing the flows in the subsurface, and determining where the greatest thickness occurs.

During 2015, the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, collected groundwater samples from 31 wells at or near the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC) at the Idaho National Laboratory for purgeable organic compounds (POCs). The samples were collected and analyzed for the purpose of evaluating whether purge water from wells located inside an areal polygon established downgradient of the INTEC must be treated as a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act listed waste.

POC concentrations in water samples from 29 of 31 wells completed in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer were greater than their detection limit, determined from detection and quantitation calculation software, for at least one to four POCs. Of the 29 wells with concentrations greater than their detection limits, only 20 had concentrations greater than the laboratory reporting limit as calculated with detection and quantitation calculation software. None of the concentrations exceeded any maximum contaminant levels established for public drinking water supplies. Most commonly detected compounds were 1,1,1-trichoroethane, 1,1-dichloroethene, and trichloroethene.

Sediment in cores from drillholes Naval Reactor Facility (NRF) 15 and United States Geologic Survey (USGS) 142 from the northern part of the Big Lost Trough (BLT) at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) document an evolution of facies during Early Pleistocene time. Although more than 95% of the upper portions of these cores is basalt, sedimentary intervals, from 520 ft to 595 ft below land surface (BLS) in NRF 15 and from 732 ft to 837 ft BLS in USGS 142 were analyzed for grain size and petrologic analysis. The large difference in depth BLS between USGS 142 and NRF 15 is accounted for by variable subsidence across the BLT. Estimated ages, based on paleomagnetic signatures of the basalt, suggest that the intervals are 884 ka-988 ka. Each interval consists of clay that grades upward to coarse silt and sand. Through grain size analysis and visual inspection of the core each interval is interpreted to represent a lake that shallows upward into shoreline sands and loess.

Three depositional environments can be interpreted from the grain size data in each of these upward coarsening intervals. The lower part of each interval is clay dominated and coarse skewed with average grain-size of 6 to 8 phi. This interval is interpreted as a shallow lake deposit. The intervals then coarsen upward to a fine-skewed silty sand, interpreted as shoreline or eolian sediment. Parts of the upper portions of sedimentary intervals in NRF 15 display bimodal grain size distributions with peaks at 2 and 8 phi; this sediment is interpreted as loess.

Point counting reveals that sands in the shoreline facies are volcanic lithic arenites (58% lithics, and of those 63% are volcanic lithics with 54% of the volcanic lithics being felsitic volcanic grains). These sands are interpreted to reflect transport via the paleo-Big Lost River, and are most likely sourced from the Challis volcanics, which are primarily dacitic and rhyodacitic in composition. The detrital zircons in the sandy intervals at 840 and 780 feet in USGS 142 resemble samples previously described from the Big Lost River. The zircon age spectra have an age peak at 45 Ma that correlates most closely with a Challis volcanic source, and a Neoproterozoic age peak at 675 Ma that correlates with granitic rocks intruded into the Pioneer Mountains core complex.

Layers of strong geologic contrast within the unsaturated zone can control recharge and contaminant transport to underlying aquifers. Slow diffuse flow in certain geologic layers, and rapid preferential flow in others, complicates the prediction of vertical and lateral fluxes. A simple model is presented, designed to use limited geological site information to predict these critical subsurface processes in response to a sustained infiltration source. The model is developed and tested using site-specific information from the Idaho National Laboratory in the Eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP), USA, where there are natural and anthropogenic sources of high-volume infiltration from floods, spills, leaks, wastewater disposal, retention ponds, and hydrologic field experiments. The thick unsaturated zone overlying the ESRP aquifer is a good example of a sharply stratified unsaturated zone. Sedimentary interbeds are interspersed between massive and fractured basalt units. The combination of surficial sediments, basalts, and interbeds determines the water fluxes through the variably saturated subsurface. Interbeds are generally less conductive, sometimes causing perched water to collect above them. The model successfully predicts the volume and extent of perching and approximates vertical travel times during events that generate high fluxes from the land surface. These developments are applicable to sites having a thick, geologically complex unsaturated zone of substantial thickness in which preferential and diffuse flow, and perching of percolated water, are important to contaminant transport or aquifer recharge.

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, has maintained a water-level monitoring program at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) since 1949. The purpose of the program is to systematically measure and report water-level data to assess the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer and long term changes in groundwater recharge, discharge, movement, and storage. Water-level data are commonly used to generate potentiometric maps and used to infer increases and (or) decreases in the regional groundwater system. Well deviation is one component of water-level data that is often overlooked and is the result of the well construction and the well not being plumb. Depending on measured slant angle, where well deviation generally increases linearly with increasing slant angle, well deviation can suggest artificial anomalies in the water table. To remove the effects of well deviation, the USGS INL Project Office applies a correction factor to water-level data when a well deviation survey indicates a change in the reference elevation of greater than or equal to 0.2 ft.

Borehole well deviation survey data were considered for 177 wells completed within the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer, but not all wells had deviation survey data available. As of 2016, USGS INL Project Office database includes: 57 wells with gyroscopic survey data; 100 wells with magnetic deviation survey data; 11 wells with erroneous gyroscopic data that were excluded; and 68 wells with no deviation survey data available. Of the 57 wells with gyroscopic deviation surveys, correction factors for 16 wells ranged from 0.20 to 6.07 ft and inclination angles (SANG) ranged from 1.6 to 16.0 degrees. Of the 100 wells with magnetic deviation surveys, a correction factor for 21 wells ranged from 0.20 to 5.78 ft and SANG ranged from 1.0 to 13.8 degrees, not including the wells that did not meet the correction factor criteria of greater than or equal to 0.20 ft.

Forty-seven wells had gyroscopic and magnetic deviation survey data for the same well. Datasets for both survey types were compared for the same well to determine whether magnetic survey data were consistent with gyroscopic survey data. Of those 47 wells, 96 percent showed similar correction factor estimates (≤ 0.20 ft) for both magnetic and gyroscopic well deviation surveys. A linear comparison of correction factor estimates for both magnetic and gyroscopic deviation well surveys for all 47 wells indicate good linear correlation, represented by an r-squared of 0.88. The correction factor difference between the gyroscopic and magnetic surveys for 45 of 47 wells ranged from 0.00 to 0.18 ft, not including USGS 57 and USGS 125. Wells USGS 57 and USGS 125 show a correction factor difference of 2.16 and 0.36 ft, respectively; however, review of the data files suggest erroneous SANG data for both magnetic deviation well surveys. The difference in magnetic and gyroscopic well deviation SANG measurements, for all wells, ranged from 0.0 to 0.9 degrees. These data indicate good agreement between SANG data measured using the magnetic deviation survey methods and SANG data measured using gyroscopic deviation survey methods, even for surveys collected years apart.

In 2015, the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, drilled and constructed boreholes TAN-2271 and TAN-2272 for stratigraphic framework analyses and long-term groundwater monitoring of the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer at the Idaho National Laboratory in southeast Idaho. Borehole TAN-2271 initially was cored to collect continuous geologic data, and then re-drilled to complete construction as a monitor well. Borehole TAN-2272 was partially cored between 210 and 282 feet (ft) below land surface (BLS) then drilled and constructed as a monitor well. Boreholes TAN-2271 and TAN-2272 are separated by about 63 ft and have similar geologic layers and hydrologic characteristics based on geologic, geophysical, and aquifer test data collected. The final construction for boreholes TAN-2271 and TAN-2272 required 10-inch (in.) diameter carbon-steel well casing and 9.9-in. diameter open-hole completion below the casing to total depths of 282 and 287 ft BLS, respectively. Depth to water is measured near 228 ft BLS in both boreholes. Following construction and data collection, temporary submersible pumps and water-level access lines were placed to allow for aquifer testing, for collecting periodic water samples, and for measuring water levels.

Borehole TAN-2271 was cored continuously, starting at the first basalt contact (about 33 ft BLS) to a depth of 284 ft BLS. Excluding surface sediment, recovery of basalt and sediment core at borehole TAN-2271 was better than 98 percent. Based on visual inspection of core and geophysical data, material examined from 33 to 211ft BLS primarily consists of two massive basalt flows that are about 78 and 50 ft in thickness and three sediment layers near 122, 197, and 201 ft BLS. Between 211 and 284 ft BLS, geophysical data and core material suggest a high occurrence of fractured and vesicular basalt. For the section of aquifer tested, there are two primary fractured aquifer intervals: the first between 235 and 255 ft BLS and the second between 272 and 282 ft BLS. Basalt texture for borehole TAN-2271 generally was described as aphanitic, phaneritic, and porphyritic. Sediment layers, starting near 122 ft BLS, generally were composed of fine-grained sand and silt with a lesser amount of clay. Basalt flows generally ranged in thickness from 2 to 78 ft and varied from highly fractured to dense with high to low vesiculation. Geophysical data and limited core material collected from TAN-2272 show similar lithologic sequences to those reported for TAN-2271.

Geophysical and borehole video logs were collected during certain stages of the drilling and construction process at boreholes TAN-2271 and TAN-2272. Geophysical logs were examined synergistically with available core material to confirm geologic and hydrologic similarities and suggest possible fractured network interconnection between boreholes TAN-2271 and TAN-2272. Natural gamma log measurements were used to assess the completeness of the vapor port lines behind 10-in. diameter well casing. Electromagnetic flow meter results were used to identify downward flow conditions that exist for boreholes TAN-2271 and TAN-2272. Furthermore, gyroscopic deviation measurements were used to measure horizontal and vertical displacement at all depths in boreholes TAN-2271 and TAN-2272.

After borehole construction was completed, single‑well aquifer tests were done within wells TAN-2271 and TAN‑2272 to provide estimates of transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity. The transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity were estimated for the pumping well and observation well during the aquifer tests conducted on August 25 and August 27, 2015. Estimates for transmissivity range from 4.1×10<sup>3</sup> feet squared per day (ft<sup>2</sup>/d) to 8.1×10<sup>3</sup> ft<sup>2</sup>/d; estimates for hydraulic conductivity range from 5.8 to 11.5 feet per day (ft/d). Both TAN-2271 and TAN‑2272 show sustained pumping rates of about 30 gallons per minute (gal/min) with measured drawdown in the pumping well of 1.96 ft and 1.14 ft, respectively. The transmissivity estimates for wells tested were within the range of values determined from previous aquifer tests in other wells near Test Area North.

Groundwater samples were collected from both wells and were analyzed for cations, anions, metals, nutrients, volatile organic compounds, stable isotopes, and radionuclides. Groundwater samples for most of the inorganic constituents showed similar water chemistry in both wells. Groundwater samples for strontium-90, trichloroethene, and vinyl chloride exceeded maximum contaminant levels for public drinking water supplies in one or both wells.

From 2009 to 2013, the U.S. Geological Survey’s (USGS) Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Project office, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, collected water-quality samples from multiple water-bearing zones in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer. Water samples were collected from 11 monitoring wells completed in about 250–750 feet of the upper part of the aquifer, and samples were analyzed for selected major ions, trace elements, nutrients, radiochemical constituents, and stable isotopes. Each well was equipped with a multilevel monitoring system containing four to seven sampling ports that were each isolated by permanent packer systems. The sampling ports were installed in aquifer zones that were highly transmissive and that represented the water chemistry of the top three to five model layers of a steady-state and transient groundwater‑flow model. The groundwater-flow model and water chemistry are being used to better define movement of wastewater constituents in the aquifer.

The water-chemistry composition of all sampled zones for the five new multilevel wells is calcium plus magnesium bicarbonate. One of the zones in well USGS 131A has a slightly different chemistry from the rest of the zones and wells and the difference is attributed to more wastewater influence from the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center. One well, USGS 135, was not influenced by wastewater disposal and consisted of mostly older water in all of its zones.

Tritium concentrations in relation to basaltic flow units indicate the presence of wastewater influence in multiple basalt flow groups; however, tritium is most abundant in the South Late Matuyama flow group in the southern boundary wells. The concentrations of wastewater constituents in deep zones in wells Middle 2051, USGS 132, USGS 105, and USGS 103 support the concept of groundwater flow deepening in the southwestern corner of the INL, as indicated by the INL groundwater-flow model.

The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, has maintained a water-level monitoring program at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) since 1949 to systematically measure water levels to provide long-term information on groundwater recharge, discharge, movement, and storage in the eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP) aquifer. During 2014, water levels in the ESRP aquifer reached all-time lows for the period of record, prompting this study to assess the effect that future water-level declines may have on pumps and wells. Water-level data were compared with pump-setting depth to determine the hydraulic head above the current pump setting. Additionally, geophysical logs were examined to address changes in well productivity with water-level declines. Furthermore, hydrologic factors that affect water levels in different areas of the INL were evaluated to help understand why water-level changes occur.

Review of pump intake placement and 2014 water-level data indicates that 40 wells completed within the ESRP aquifer at the INL have 20 feet (ft) or less of head above the pump. Nine of these wells are located in the northeastern and northwestern areas of the INL where recharge is predominantly affected by irrigation, wet and dry cycles of precipitation, and flow in the Big Lost River. Water levels in northeastern and northwestern wells generally show water-level fluctuations of as much as 4.5 ft seasonally and show declines as much as 25 ft during the past 14 years.

In the southeastern area of the INL, seven wells were identified as having less than 20 ft of water remaining above the pump. Most of the wells in the southeast show less decline over the period of record compared with wells in the northeast; the smaller declines are probably attributable to less groundwater withdrawal from pumping of wells for irrigation. In addition, most of the southeastern wells show only about a 1–2 ft fluctuation seasonally because they are less influenced by groundwater withdrawals for irrigation.

In the southwestern area of the INL, 24 wells were identified as having less than 20 ft of water remaining above the pump. Wells in the southwest also only show small 1–2 ft fluctuations seasonally because of a lack of irrigation influence. Wells show larger fluctuation in water levels closer to the Big Lost River and fluctuate in response to wet and dry cycles of recharge to the Big Lost River.

Geophysical logs indicate that most of the wells evaluated will maintain their current production until the water level declines to the depth of the pump. A few of the wells may become less productive once the water level gets to within about 5 ft from the top of the pump. Wells most susceptible to future drought cycles are those in the northeastern and northwestern areas of the INL.

The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, analyzed water-quality data collected from 64 aquifer wells and 35 perched groundwater wells at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) from 1981 through 2012. The wells selected for the study were wells that possibly were affected by wastewater disposal at the INL. The data analyzed included tritium, strontium-90, major cations, anions, nutrients, trace elements, total organic carbon, and volatile organic compounds. The analyses were performed to examine water-quality trends that might influence future management decisions about the number of wells to sample at the INL and the type of constituents to monitor.

The data were processed using custom computer scripts developed in the R programming language. Summary statistics were calculated for the datasets. Water-quality trends were determined using a parametric survival regression model to fit the observed data, including left-censored, interval-censored, and uncensored data. The null hypothesis of the trend test was that no relation existed between time and concentration; the alternate hypothesis was that time and concentration were related through the regression equation. A significance level of 0.05 was selected to determine if the trend was statistically significant.

Trend test results for tritium and strontium-90 concentrations in aquifer wells indicated that nearly all wells had decreasing or no trends. Similarly, trends in perched groundwater wells were mostly decreasing or no trends; trends were increasing in two perched groundwater wells near the Advanced Test Reactor Complex. Decreasing trends generally are attributed to lack of recent wastewater disposal and radioactive decay.

Trend test results for chloride, sodium, sulfate, nitrite plus nitrate (as nitrogen), chromium, trace elements, and total organic carbon concentrations in aquifer wells indicated that most wells had either decreasing or no trends. The decreasing trends in these constituents are attributed to decrease in disposal of these constituents, as well as discontinued use of the old percolation ponds south of the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC) and redirection of wastewater to the new percolation ponds 2 miles southwest of the INTEC in 2002.

Chloride (along with sodium, sulfate, and some nitrate) concentrations in wells south of the INTEC may be influenced by episodic recharge from the Big Lost River. These constituent concentrations decrease during wetter periods when there is probably more recharge from the Big Lost River and increase during dry periods, when there is less recharge.

Some wells downgradient of the Central Facilities Area and near the southern boundary of the INL showed increasing trends in sodium concentration, whereas there was no trend in chloride. The increasing trend for sodium could be due to the long term influence of wastewater disposal from upgradient facilities and the lack of trend for chloride could be because chloride is more mobile than sodium and more dispersed in the aquifer system.

Volatile organic compound concentration trends were analyzed for nine aquifer wells. Trend test results indicated an increasing trend for carbon tetrachloride for the Radioactive Waste Management Complex Production Well for the period 1987–2012; however, trend analyses of data collected since 2005 show no statistically significant trend indicating that engineering practices designed to reduce movement of volatile organic compounds to the aquifer may be having a positive effect on the aquifer.

In 2011, the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, collected samples for 12 new argon-argon radiometric ages from eastern Snake River Plain olivine tholeiite basalt flows in the subsurface at the Idaho National Laboratory. The core samples were collected from flows that had previously published paleomagnetic data. Samples were sent to Rutgers University for argon-argon radiometric dating analyses.

Paleomagnetic and stratigraphic data were used to constrain the results of the age dating experiments to derive the preferred age for each basalt flow. Knowledge of the ages of subsurface basalt flows is needed to improve numerical models of groundwater flow and contaminant transport in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer. This could be accomplished by increasing the ability to correlate basalt flow from corehole to corehole in the subsurface. The age of basalt flows also can be used in volcanic recurrence and landscape evolution studies that are important to better understand future hazards that could occur at the Idaho National Laboratory.

Results indicate that ages ranged from 60±16 thousand years ago for Quaking Aspen Butte to 621±9 thousand years ago for State Butte.

Groundwater with elevated dissolved-solids concentrations—containing large concentrations of chloride, sodium, sulfate, and calcium—is present in the Mud Lake area of Eastern Idaho. The source of these solutes is unknown; however, an understanding of the geochemical sources and processes controlling their presence in groundwater in the Mud Lake area is needed to better understand the geochemical sources and processes controlling the water quality of groundwater at the Idaho National Laboratory. The geochemical sources and processes controlling the water quality of groundwater in the Mud Lake area were determined by investigating the geology, hydrology, land use, and groundwater geochemistry in the Mud Lake area, proposing sources for solutes, and testing the proposed sources through geochemical modeling with PHREEQC. Modeling indicated that sources of water to the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer were groundwater from the Beaverhead Mountains and the Camas Creek drainage basin; surface water from Medicine Lodge and Camas Creeks, Mud Lake, and irrigation water; and upward flow of geothermal water from beneath the aquifer. Mixing of groundwater with surface water or other groundwater occurred throughout the aquifer. Carbonate reactions, silicate weathering, and dissolution of evaporite minerals and fertilizer explain most of the changes in chemistry in the aquifer. Redox reactions, cation exchange, and evaporation were locally important. The source of large concentrations of chloride, sodium, sulfate, and calcium was evaporite deposits in the unsaturated zone associated with Pleistocene Lake Terreton. Large amounts of chloride, sodium, sulfate, and calcium are added to groundwater from irrigation water infiltrating through lake bed sediments containing evaporite deposits and the resultant dissolution of gypsum, halite, sylvite, and bischofite.

From 2011 to 2013, the U.S. Geological Survey’s Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Project Office, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, collected depth-discrete measurements of fluid pressure and temperature in 11 boreholes located in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer. Each borehole was instrumented with a multilevel monitoring system (MLMS) consisting of a series of valved measurement ports, packer bladders, casing segments, and couplers.

Multilevel monitoring at the INL has been ongoing since 2006 and this report summarizes data collected from 2011 to 2013 in 11 multilevel monitoring wells. Hydraulic head (head) and groundwater temperature data were collected from 11 multilevel monitoring wells, including 177 hydraulically isolated depth intervals from 448.0 to 1,377.6 feet below land surface. One port (port 3) within borehole USGS 134 was not monitored because of a valve failure.

Head and temperature profiles reveal unique patterns for vertical examination of the aquifer’s complex basalt and sediment stratigraphy, proximity to aquifer recharge and discharge, and groundwater flow. These features contribute to some of the localized variability even though the general profile shape remained consistent over the period of record. Twenty-two major head inflections were described for 9 of 11 MLMS boreholes and almost always coincided with low‑permeability sediment layers and occasionally thick layers of dense basalt. However, the presence of a sediment layer or dense basalt layer was insufficient for identifying the location of a major head change within a borehole without knowing the true areal extent and relative transmissivity of the lithologic unit. Temperature profiles for boreholes completed within the Big Lost Trough indicate linear conductive trends; whereas, temperature profiles for boreholes completed within volcanic rift zones and near the southern boundary of the Idaho National Laboratory, indicate mostly convective heat transfer. Select boreholes along the southern boundary show a temperature reversal and cooler water deeper in the aquifer resulting from the vertical movement of groundwater.

Vertical head and temperature change were quantified for each of the 11 multilevel monitoring systems. Vertical head gradients defined for the major inflections in the head profiles were as high as 2.9 feet per foot. In general, fractured basalt zones displayed relatively small vertical head differences and show a high occurrence within volcanic rift zones. Poor connectivity between fractures and higher vertical gradients were generally attributed to sediment layers and layers of dense basalt, or both. Groundwater temperatures in all boreholes ranged from 10.8 to 16.3 °C.

Normalized mean head values were analyzed for all 11 multilevel monitoring wells for the period of record (2007–13). The mean head values suggest a moderately positive correlation among all boreholes and generally reflect regional fluctuations in water levels in response to seasonal climatic changes. Boreholes within volcanic rift zones and near the southern boundary (USGS 103, USGS 105, USGS 108, USGS 132, USGS 135, USGS 137A) display a temporal correlation that is strongly positive. Boreholes in the Big Lost Trough display some variations in temporal correlations that may result from proximity to the mountain front to the northwest and episodic flow in the Big Lost River drainage system. For example, during June 2012, boreholes MIDDLE 2050A and MIDDLE 2051 showed head buildup within the upper zones when compared to the June 2010 profile event, which correlates to years when surface water was reported for the Big Lost River several months preceding the measurement period. With the exception of borehole USGS 134, temporal correlation between MLMS wells completed within the Big Lost Trough is generally positive. Temporal correlation for borehole USGS 134 shows the least agreement with other MLMS boreholes located within the Big Lost Trough; however, borehole USGS 134 is close to the mountain front where tributary valley subsurface inflow is suspected.

Water-quality activities and water-level measurements by the personnel of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Project Office coincide with the USGS mission of appraising the quantity and quality of the Nation’s water resources. The activities are carried out in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Idaho Operations Office. Results of the water-quality and hydraulic head investigations are presented in various USGS publications or in refereed scientific journals and the data are stored in the National Water Information System (NWIS) database. The results of the studies are used by researchers, regulatory and managerial agencies, and interested civic groups. In the broadest sense, quality assurance refers to doing the job right the first time. It includes the functions of planning for products, review and acceptance of the products, and an audit designed to evaluate the system that produces the products. Quality control and quality assurance differ in that quality control ensures that things are done correctly given the state-of-the-art technology, and quality assurance ensures that quality control is maintained within specified limits.

Operations at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) have the potential to contaminate the underlying Eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP) aquifer. Methods to quantitatively characterize unsaturated flow and recharge to the ESRP aquifer are needed to inform water-resources management decisions at INL. In particular, hydraulic properties are needed to parameterize distributed hydrologic models of unsaturated flow and transport at INL, but these properties are often difficult and costly to obtain for large areas. The unsaturated zone overlying the ESRP aquifer consists of alternating sequences of thick fractured volcanic rocks that can rapidly transmit water flow and thinner sedimentary interbeds that transmit water much more slowly. Consequently, the sedimentary interbeds are of considerable interest because they primarily restrict the vertical movement of water through the unsaturated zone. Previous efforts by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) have included extensive laboratory characterization of the sedimentary interbeds and regression analyses to develop property-transfer models, which relate readily available physical properties of the sedimentary interbeds (bulk density, median particle diameter, and uniformity coefficient) to water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curves.

During 2013–14, the USGS, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, focused on further characterization of the sedimentary interbeds below the future site of the proposed Remote Handled Low-Level Waste (RHLLW) facility, which is intended for the long-term disposal of low-level radioactive waste. Twelve core samples from the sedimentary interbeds from a borehole near the proposed facility were collected for laboratory analysis of hydraulic properties, which also allowed further testing of the property-transfer modeling approach. For each core sample, the steady-state centrifuge method was used to measure relations between matric potential, saturation, and conductivity. These laboratory measurements were compared to water-retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity parameters estimated using the established property-transfer models. For each core sample obtained, the agreement between measured and estimated hydraulic parameters was evaluated quantitatively using the Pearson correlation coefficient (r). The highest correlation is for saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) with an r value of 0.922. The saturated water content (qsat) also exhibits a strong linear correlation with an r value of 0.892. The curve shape parameter (&lambda;) has a value of 0.731, whereas the curve scaling parameter (yo) has the lowest r value of 0.528. The r values demonstrate that model predictions correspond well to the laboratory measured properties for most parameters, which supports the value of extending this approach for quantifying unsaturated hydraulic properties at various sites throughout INL.

Quality-control (QC) samples were collected from 2002 through 2008 by the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, to ensure data robustness by documenting the variability and bias of water-quality data collected at surface-water and groundwater sites at and near the Idaho National Laboratory. QC samples consisted of 139 replicates and 22 blanks (approximately 11 percent of the number of environmental samples collected). Measurements from replicates were used to estimate variability (from field and laboratory procedures and sample heterogeneity), as reproducibility and reliability, of water-quality measurements of radiochemical, inorganic, and organic constituents. Measurements from blanks were used to estimate the potential contamination bias of selected radiochemical and inorganic constituents in water-quality samples, with an emphasis on identifying any cross contamination of samples collected with portable sampling equipment.

The reproducibility of water-quality measurements was estimated with calculations of normalized absolute difference for radiochemical constituents and relative standard deviation (RSD) for inorganic and organic constituents. The reliability of water-quality measurements was estimated with pooled RSDs for all constituents. Reproducibility was acceptable for all constituents except dissolved aluminum and total organic carbon. Pooled RSDs were equal to or less than 14 percent for all constituents except for total organic carbon, which had pooled RSDs of 70 percent for the low concentration range and 4.4 percent for the high concentration range.

Source-solution and equipment blanks were measured for concentrations of tritium, strontium-90, cesium-137, sodium, chloride, sulfate, and dissolved chromium. Field blanks were measured for the concentration of iodide. No detectable concentrations were measured from the blanks except for strontium-90 in one source solution and one equipment blank collected in September and October 2004, respectively. The detectable concentrations of strontium-90 in the blanks probably were from a small source of strontium-90 contamination or large measurement variability, or both.

Order statistics and the binomial probability distribution were used to estimate the magnitude and extent of any potential contamination bias of tritium, strontium-90, cesium-137, sodium, chloride, sulfate, dissolved chromium, and iodide in water-quality samples. These statistical methods indicated that, with (1) 87 percent confidence, contamination bias of cesium-137 and sodium in 60 percent of water-quality samples was less than the minimum detectable concentration or reporting level; (2) 92–94 percent confidence, contamination bias of tritium, strontium-90, chloride, sulfate, and dissolved chromium in 70 percent of water-quality samples was less than the minimum detectable concentration or reporting level; and (3) 75 percent confidence, contamination bias of iodide in 50 percent of water-quality samples was less than the reporting level for iodide. These results support the conclusion that contamination bias of water-quality samples from sample processing, storage, shipping, and analysis was insignificant and that cross-contamination of perched groundwater samples collected with bailers during 2002–08 was insignificant.

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, is studying the fate and transport of waste solutes in the eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP) aquifer at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) in eastern Idaho. This effort requires an understanding of the natural and anthropogenic geochemistry of groundwater at the INL and of the important physical and chemical processes controlling the geochemistry. In this study, the USGS applied geochemical modeling to investigate the geochemistry of groundwater in the Beaver and Camas Creek drainage basins, which provide groundwater recharge to the ESRP aquifer underlying the northeastern part of the INL.

Data used in this study include petrology and mineralogy from 2 sediment and 3 rock samples, and water-quality analyses from 4 surface-water and 18 groundwater samples. The mineralogy of the sediment and rock samples was analyzed with X-ray diffraction, and the mineralogy and petrology of the rock samples were examined in thin sections. The water samples were analyzed for field parameters, major ions, silica, nutrients, dissolved organic carbon, trace elements, tritium, and the stable isotope ratios of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen.

Groundwater geochemistry was influenced by reactions with rocks of the geologic terranes—carbonate rocks, rhyolite, basalt, evaporite deposits, and sediment comprised of all of these rocks. Agricultural practices near and south of Dubois and application of road anti-icing liquids on U.S. Interstate Highway 15 were likely sources of nitrate, chloride, calcium, and magnesium to groundwater.

Groundwater geochemistry was successfully modeled in the alluvial aquifer in Camas Meadows and the ESRP fractured basalt aquifer using the geochemical modeling code PHREEQC. The primary geochemical processes appear to be precipitation or dissolution of calcite and dissolution of silicate minerals. Dissolution of evaporite minerals, associated with Pleistocene Lake Terreton, is an important contributor of solutes in the Mud Lake-Dubois area. Oxidation-reduction reactions are important influences on the chemistry of groundwater at Camas Meadows and the Camas National Wildlife Refuge. In addition, mixing of different groundwaters or surface water with groundwater appears to be an important physical process influencing groundwater geochemistry in much of the study area, and evaporation may be an important physical process influencing the groundwater geochemistry of the Camas National Wildlife Refuge. The mass-balance modeling results from this study provide an explanation of the natural geochemistry of groundwater in the ESRP aquifer northeast of the INL, and thus provide a starting point for evaluating the natural and anthropogenic geochemistry of groundwater at the INL.

In 2013, the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, drilled and constructed boreholes USGS 140 and USGS 141 for stratigraphic framework analyses and long-term groundwater monitoring of the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer at the Idaho National Laboratory in southeast Idaho. Borehole USGS 140 initially was cored to collect continuous geologic data, and then re-drilled to complete construction as a monitor well. Borehole USGS 141 was drilled and constructed as a monitor well without coring. Boreholes USGS 140 and USGS 141 are separated by about 375 feet (ft) and have similar geologic layers and hydrologic characteristics based on geophysical and aquifer test data collected. The final construction for boreholes USGS 140 and USGS 141 required 6-inch (in.) diameter carbon-steel well casing and 5-in. diameter stainless-steel well screen; the screened monitoring interval was completed about 50 ft into the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer, between 496 and 546 ft below land surface (BLS) at both sites. Following construction and data collection, dedicated pumps and water-level access lines were placed to allow for aquifer testing, for collecting periodic water samples, and for measuring water levels.

Borehole USGS 140 was cored continuously, starting from land surface to a depth of 543 ft BLS. Excluding surface sediment, recovery of basalt and sediment core at borehole USGS 140 was about 98 and 65 percent, respectively. Based on visual inspection of core and geophysical data, about 32 basalt flows and 4 sediment layers were collected from borehole USGS 140 between 34 and 543 ft BLS. Basalt texture for borehole USGS 140 generally was described as aphanitic, phaneritic, and porphyritic; rubble zones and flow mold structure also were described in recovered core material. Sediment layers, starting near 163 ft BLS, generally were composed of fine-grained sand and silt with a lesser amount of clay; however, between 223 and 228 ft BLS, silt with gravel was described. Basalt flows generally ranged in thickness from 3 to 76 ft (average of 14 ft) and varied from highly fractured to dense with high to low vesiculation.

Geophysical and borehole video logs were collected during certain stages of the drilling and construction process at boreholes USGS 140 and USGS 141. Geophysical logs were examined synergistically with the core material for borehole USGS 140; additionally, geophysical data were examined to confirm geologic and hydrologic similarities between boreholes USGS 140 and USGS 141 because core was not collected for borehole USGS 141. Geophysical data suggest the occurrence of fractured and (or) vesiculated basalt, dense basalt, and sediment layering in both the saturated and unsaturated zones in borehole USGS 141. Omni-directional density measurements were used to assess the completeness of the grout annular seal behind 6-in. diameter well casing. Furthermore, gyroscopic deviation measurements were used to measure horizontal and vertical displacement at all depths in boreholes USGS 140 and USGS 141.

Single-well aquifer tests were done following construction at wells USGS 140 and USGS 141 and data examined after the tests were used to provide estimates of specific-capacity, transmissivity, and hydraulic conductivity. The specific capacity, transmissivity, and hydraulic conductivity for well USGS 140 were estimated at 2,370 gallons per minute per foot [(gal/min)/ft)], 4.06×10<sup>5</sup> feet squared per day (ft<sup>2</sup>/d), and 740 feet per day (ft/d), respectively. The specific capacity, transmissivity, and hydraulic conductivity for well USGS 141 were estimated at 470 (gal/min)/ft, 5.95×10<sup>4</sup> ft<sup>2</sup>/d, and 110 ft/d, respectively. Measured flow rates remained relatively constant in well USGS 140 with averages of 23.9 and 23.7 gal/min during the first and second aquifer tests, respectively, and in well USGS 141 with an average of 23.4 gal/min.

Water samples were analyzed for cations, anions, metals, nutrients, volatile organic compounds, stable isotopes, and radionuclides. Water samples from both wells indicated that concentrations of tritium, sulfate, and chromium were affected by wastewater disposal practices at the Advanced Test Reactor Complex. Most constituents in water from wells USGS 140 and USGS 141 had concentrations similar to concentrations in well USGS 136, which is upgradient from wells USGS 140 and USGS 141.

From 1953 to 1988, approximately 0.941 curies of iodine-129 (<sup>129</sup>I) were contained in wastewater generated at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) with almost all of this wastewater discharged at or near the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC). Most of the wastewater containing <sup>129</sup>I was discharged directly into the eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP) aquifer through a deep disposal well until 1984; lesser quantities also were discharged into unlined infiltration ponds or leaked from distribution systems below the INTEC.

During 2010–12, the U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy collected groundwater samples for <sup>129</sup>I from 62 wells in the ESRP aquifer to track concentration trends and changes for the carcinogenic radionuclide that has a 15.7 million-year half-life. Concentrations of <sup>129</sup>I in the aquifer ranged from 0.0000013±0.0000005 to 1.02±0.04 picocuries per liter (pCi/L), and generally decreased in wells near the INTEC, relative to previous sampling events. The average concentration of <sup>129</sup>I in groundwater from 15 wells sampled during four different sample periods decreased from 1.15 pCi/L in 1990–91 to 0.173 pCi/L in 2011–12. All but two wells within a 3-mile radius of the INTEC showed decreases in concentration, and all but one sample had concentrations less than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency maximum contaminant level of 1 pCi/L. These decreases are attributed to the discontinuation of disposal of <sup>129</sup>I in wastewater and to dilution and dispersion in the aquifer. The decreases in <sup>129</sup>I concentrations, in areas around INTEC where concentrations increased between 2003 and 2007, were attributed to less recharge near INTEC either from less flow in the Big Lost River or from less local snowmelt and anthropogenic sources.

Although wells near INTEC sampled in 2011–12 showed decreases in <sup>129</sup>I concentrations compared with previously collected data, some wells south and east of the Central Facilities Area, near the site boundary, and south of the INL showed small increases. These slight increases are attributed to variable discharge rates of wastewater that eventually moved to these well locations as a pulse of water from a particular disposal period.

Wells sampled for the first time around the Naval Reactors Facility had <sup>129</sup>I concentrations slightly greater than background concentrations in the ESRP aquifer. These concentrations are attributed to either seepage of unknown wastewater sources discharged at the Naval Reactors Facility or seepage from air emission deposits from INTEC, or both.

In 2012, the U.S. Geological Survey collected discrete groundwater samples from 25 zones in 11 wells equipped with multilevel monitoring systems to help define the vertical distribution of <sup>129</sup>I in the aquifer. Concentrations ranged from 0.000006±0.000004 to 0.082±0.003 pCi/L. Two new wells completed in 2012 showed variability of up to one order of magnitude of concentrations of <sup>129</sup>I among various zones. Two other wells showed similar concentrations of <sup>129</sup>I in all three zones sampled. Concentrations were well less than the maximum contaminant level in all zones.

Starting in 2008, a 4‐year tracer study was conducted to evaluate ambient changes in groundwater concentrations of a 1,3,6‐naphthalene trisulfonate tracer that was added to drill water. Samples were collected under open borehole conditions and after installing a multilevel groundwater monitoring system completed with 11 discrete monitoring zones within dense and fractured basalt and sediment layers in the eastern Snake River aquifer. The study was done in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy to test whether ambient fracture flow conditions were sufficient to remove the effects of injected drill water prior to sample collection. Results from thief samples indicated that the tracer was present in minor concentrations 28 days after coring, but was not present 6 months after coring or 7 days after reaming the borehole. Results from sampling the multilevel monitoring system indicated that small concentrations of the tracer remained in 5 of 10 zones during some period after installation. All concentrations were several orders of magnitude lower than the initial concentrations in the drill water. The ports that had remnant concentrations of the tracer were either located near sediment layers or were located in dense basalt, which suggests limited groundwater flow near these ports. The ports completed in well‐fractured and vesicular basalt had no detectable concentrations.

Paleomagnetic inclination and polarity studies were conducted on subcore samples from eight coreholes located at and near the Naval Reactors Facility (NRF), Idaho National Laboratory (INL). These studies were used to characterize and to correlate successive stratigraphic basalt flow groups in each corehole to basalt flow groups with similar paleomagnetic inclinations in adjacent coreholes. Results were used to extend the subsurface geologic framework at the INL previously derived from paleomagnetic data for south INL coreholes. Geologic framework studies are used in conceptual and numerical models of groundwater flow and contaminant transport. Sample handling and demagnetization protocols are described, as well as the paleomagnetic data averaging process.

Paleomagnetic inclination comparisons among NRF coreholes show comparable stratigraphic successions of mean inclination values over tens to hundreds of meters of depth. Corehole USGS 133 is more than 5 kilometers from the nearest NRF area corehole, and the mean inclination values of basalt flow groups in that corehole are somewhat less consistent than with NRF area basalt flow groups. Some basalt flow groups in USGS 133 are missing, additional basalt flow groups are present, or the basalt flow groups are at depths different from those of NRF area coreholes.

Age experiments on young, low potassium olivine tholeiite basalts may yield inconclusive results; paleomagnetic and stratigraphic data were used to choose the most reasonable ages. Results of age experiments using conventional potassium argon and argon-40/argon-39 protocols indicate that the youngest and uppermost basalt flow group in the NRF area is 303±30 ka and that the oldest and deepest basalt flow group analyzed is 884±53 ka.

A south to north line of cross-section drawn through the NRF coreholes shows corehole-to-corehole basalt flow group correlations derived from the paleomagnetic inclination data. From stratigraphic top to bottom, key results include the following:

The West of Advanced Test Reactor Complex (ATRC) flow group is the uppermost basalt flow group in the NRF area and correlates among seven continuously cored holes in this study under surficial sediments. The West of ATRC flow group is also found in coreholes near the ATRC, the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC), and in corehole USGS 129.

The ATRC Unknown Vent flow group correlates among seven continuously cored holes in this study underlying the West of ATRC flow group and a sedimentary interbed. Additional paleomagnetic inclination and stratigraphic data derived from the NRF coreholes changed the previously reported interpretation of the subsurface distribution of this basalt flow group. The ATRC Unknown Vent flow group also is found in coreholes near the ATRC and INTEC.

The Central Facilities Area (CFA) Buried Vent flow group correlates among all eight coreholes in the NRF area. It also is found in coreholes near the CFA and the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC) to the south. This basalt flow group is thickest near the CFA, which may indicate proximity to the vent. The State Butte flow group is found below the CFA Buried Vent flow group in the four northern NRF coreholes. It correlates to the State Butte surface vent located just northeast of the NRF. It is not found in coreholes south of the NRF.

The Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Butte flow group is found in coreholes USGS 133, NRF 6P, and NRF 7P. It probably underlies coreholes NRF B18-1, NRF 89-05, and NRF 89-04, but those coreholes were not drilled deeply enough to penetrate the flow group. The AEC Butte flow group vent is exposed at the surface near the ATRC, and its flows are found in many coreholes near the ATRC and INTEC. The AEC Butte flow group abruptly pinches out against the Matuyama Chron reversed polarity flows of the East Matuyama Middle flow group between coreholes NRF 7P and NRF 15.

The East Matuyama Middle flow group correlates between coreholes NRF 15 and NRF 16 and may correlate to coreholes NPR Test/W-02 and ANL-OBS-A-001.

The North Late Matuyama flow group correlates among coreholes USGS 133, NRF 6P, NRF 7P, NRF 15, and NRF 16. It probably underlies coreholes NRF B18-1, NRF 89-05, and NRF 89-04, but those coreholes were not drilled deeply enough to penetrate the flow group. The vent that produced the North Late Matuyama flow group may be located in the general NRF area because it is thickest near corehole NRF 6P.

The Matuyama flow group is found in coreholes in the southern INL from south of the RWMC to corehole USGS 133 and may extend north to corehole NRF 15. The Matuyama flow group is thickest near the RWMC and thins to the north.

The Jaramillo (Matuyama) flow group is found in corehole NRF 15, which is the deepest NRF corehole, and shows that the basalt flow group is thick in the subsurface at NRF. This flow group is thickest between the RWMC and INTEC and thins towards the ATRC and NRF.

Since 1952, wastewater discharged to infiltration ponds (also called percolation ponds) and disposal wells at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has affected water quality in the eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP) aquifer and perched groundwater zones underlying the INL. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, maintains groundwater monitoring networks at the INL to determine hydrologic trends, and to delineate the movement of radiochemical and chemical wastes in the aquifer and in perched groundwater zones. This report presents an analysis of water-level and water-quality data collected from aquifer, multilevel monitoring system (MLMS), and perched groundwater wells in the USGS groundwater monitoring networks during 2009–11.

Water in the ESRP aquifer primarily moves through fractures and interflow zones in basalt, generally flows southwestward, and eventually discharges at springs along the Snake River. The aquifer primarily is recharged from infiltration of irrigation water, infiltration of streamflow, groundwater inflow from adjoining mountain drainage basins, and infiltration of precipitation.

From March–May 2009 to March–May 2011, water levels in wells generally declined in the northern part of the INL. Water levels generally rose in the central and eastern parts of the INL.

Detectable concentrations of radiochemical constituents in water samples from aquifer wells or MLMS equipped wells in the ESRP aquifer at the INL generally decreased or remained constant during 2009–11. Decreases in concentrations were attributed to radioactive decay, changes in waste-disposal methods, and dilution from recharge and underflow.

In 2011, concentrations of tritium in groundwater from 50 of 127 aquifer wells were greater than or equal to the reporting level and ranged from 200±60 to 7,000±260 picocuries per liter. Tritium concentrations from one or more discrete zones from four wells equipped with MLMS were greater than or equal to reporting levels in water samples collected at various depths. Tritium concentrations in water from wells completed in shallow perched groundwater at the Advanced Test Reactor Complex (ATR Complex) were less than the reporting levels. Tritium concentrations in deep perched groundwater at the ATR Complex equaled or exceeded the reporting level in 12 wells during at least one sampling event during 2009–11 at the ATR Complex.

Concentrations of strontium-90 in water from 20 of 76 aquifer wells sampled during April or October 2011 exceeded the reporting level. Strontium-90 was not detected within the ESRP aquifer beneath the ATR Complex. During at least one sampling event during 2009–11, concentrations of strontium-90 in water from 10 wells completed in deep perched groundwater at the ATR Complex equaled or exceeded the reporting levels.

During 2009–11, concentrations of plutonium-238, and plutonium-239, -240 (undivided), and americium-241 were less than the reporting level in water samples from all aquifer wells and in all wells equipped with MLMS. Concentrations of cesium-137 were equal to or slightly above the reporting level in 8 aquifer wells and from 2 wells equipped with MLMS.

The concentration of chromium in water from one well south of the ATR Complex was 97 micrograms per liter (μg/L) in April 2011, just less than the maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 100 μg/L. Concentrations of chromium in water samples from 69 other wells sampled ranged from 0.8 μg/L to 25 μg/L. During 2009–11, dissolved chromium was detected in water from 15 wells completed in perched groundwater at the ATR Complex.

In 2011, concentrations of sodium in water from most wells in the southern part of the INL were greater than the background concentration of 10 milligrams per liter (mg/L); the highest concentrations were at or near the Idaho Nuclear Engineering and Technology Center (INTEC). After the new percolation ponds were put into service in 2002 southwest of the INTEC, concentrations of sodium in water samples from the Rifle Range well rose steadily until 2008, when the concentrations generally began decreasing. The increases and decreases were attributed to disposal variability in the new percolation ponds. Concentrations of sodium in most wells equipped with MLMS generally were consistent with depth. During 2011, dissolved sodium concentrations in water from 17 wells completed in deep perched groundwater at the ATR Complex ranged from 6 to 146 mg/L.

In 2011, concentrations of chloride in most water samples from aquifer wells south of the INTEC and at the Central Facilities Area exceeded the background concentrations of 15 mg/L, but were less than the secondary MCL of 250 mg/L. Chloride concentrations in water from wells south of the INTEC have generally increased because of increased chloride disposal to the old percolation ponds since 1984 when discharge of wastewater to the INTEC disposal well was discontinued. After the new percolation ponds were put into service in 2002 southwest of the INTEC, concentrations of chloride in water samples from one well rose steadily until 2008 then began decreasing. Chloride concentrations in water from all but one well completed in the ESRP aquifer at or near the ATR Complex were less than background and ranged between 10 and 14 mg/L during 2011, similar to concentrations detected during the 2006–08 reporting period. During 2011, chloride concentrations in water from two aquifer wells at the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC) were slightly greater than concentrations detected during the 2006–08 reporting period. The vertical distribution of chloride concentrations in wells equipped with MLMS were generally consistent within zones during 2009–11 and ranged from about 8 to 20 mg/L. During April 2011, dissolved chloride concentrations in shallow perched groundwater at the ATR Complex ranged from 7 to 13 mg/L in water from three wells. Dissolved chloride concentrations in deep perched groundwater at the ATR Complex during 2011 ranged from 4 to 54 mg/L.

In 2011, sulfate concentrations in water samples from 11 aquifer wells in the south-central part of the INL equaled or exceeded the background concentration of sulfate and ranged from 40 to 167 mg/L. The greater-than-background concentrations in water from these wells probably resulted from sulfate disposal at the ATR Complex infiltration ponds or the old INTEC percolation ponds. In 2011, sulfate concentrations in water samples from two wells near the RWMC were greater than background levels and could have resulted from well construction techniques and (or) waste disposal at the RWMC. The vertical distribution of sulfate concentrations in three wells near the southern boundary of the INL was generally consistent with depth, and ranged between 19 and 25 mg/L. The maximum dissolved sulfate concentration in shallow perched groundwater near the ATR Complex was 400 mg/L in well CWP 1 in April 2011. During 2009–11, the maximum concentration of dissolved sulfate in deep perched groundwater at the ATR Complex was 1,550 mg/L in a well located west of the chemical-waste pond.

In 2011, concentrations of nitrate in water from most wells at and near the INTEC exceeded the regional background concentrations of 1 mg/L and ranged from 1.6 to 5.95 mg/L. Concentrations of nitrate in wells south of INTEC and farther away from the influence of disposal areas and the Big Lost River show a general decrease in nitrate concentrations through time.

During 2009–11, water samples from 30 wells were collected and analyzed for volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Six VOCs were detected. At least one and up to five VOCs were detected in water samples from 10 wells. The primary VOCs detected include carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, tetrachloroethylene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, and trichloroethylene. In 2011, concentrations for all VOCs were less than their respective MCL for drinking water, except carbon tetrachloride in water from two wells.

During 2009–11, variability and bias were evaluated from 56 replicate and 16 blank quality-assurance samples. Results from replicate analyses were investigated to evaluate sample variability. Constituents with acceptable reproducibility were stable isotope ratios, major ions, nutrients, and VOCs. All radiochemical constituents and trace metals had acceptable reproducibility except for gross beta-particle radioactivity, aluminum, antimony, and cobalt. Bias from sample contamination was evaluated from equipment, field, container, and source-solution blanks. No detectable constituent concentrations were reported for equipment blanks of the thief samplers and sampling pipes or for the source-solution and field blanks. Equipment blanks of bailers had detectable concentrations of strontium-90, sodium, chloride, and sulfate, and the container blank had a detectable concentration of dichloromethane.

Long-term groundwater monitoring networks can provide essential information for the planning and management of water resources. Budget constraints in water resource management agencies often mean a reduction in the number of observation wells included in a monitoring network. A network design tool, distributed as an R package, was developed to determine which wells to exclude from a monitoring network because they add little or no beneficial information. A kriging-based genetic algorithm method was used to optimize the monitoring network. The algorithm was used to find the set of wells whose removal leads to the smallest increase in the weighted sum of the (1) mean standard error at all nodes in the kriging grid where the water table is estimated, (2) root-mean-squared-error between the measured and estimated water-level elevation at the removed sites, (3) mean standard deviation of measurements across time at the removed sites, and (4) mean measurement error of wells in the reduced network. The solution to the optimization problem (the best wells to retain in the monitoring network) depends on the total number of wells removed; this number is a management decision. The network design tool was applied to optimize two observation well networks monitoring the water table of the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer, Idaho; these networks include the 2008 Federal-State Cooperative water-level monitoring network (Co-op network) with 166 observation wells, and the 2008 U.S. Geological Survey-Idaho National Laboratory water-level monitoring network (USGS-INL network) with 171 wells. Each water-level monitoring network was optimized five times: by removing (1) 10, (2) 20, (3) 40, (4) 60, and (5) 80 observation wells from the original network. An examination of the trade-offs associated with changes in the number of wells to remove indicates that 20 wells can be removed from the Co-op network with a relatively small degradation of the estimated water table map, and 40 wells can be removed from the USGS-INL network before the water table map degradation accelerates. The optimal network designs indicate the robustness of the network design tool. Observation wells were removed from high well-density areas of the network while retaining the spatial pattern of the existing water-table map.

This thesis describes and interprets the solute chemistry and hydrogeology of the Medicine Lodge Creek drainage basin in eastern Idaho as part of a comprehensive study by the U.S. Geological Survey of the natural geochemistry of the Eastern Snake River Plain Aquifer at the Idaho National Laboratory.

Water samples were collected from three springs and seven wells and analyzed for field parameters, major ions, trace elements, nutrients, tritium, and stable isotope ratios of hydrogen and oxygen. Rock and sediment samples were collected from outcrops and streams and analyzed using granulometric, X-ray diffraction, and petrographic methods.

Modeling of water-rock interactions was accomplished using PHREEQC software. Waters are calcium-magnesium-bicarbonate type and show evidence of anthropogenic influences. Host-rock weathering processes, including precipitation of clay, controls the solute chemistry in the northern portion of the drainage basin while southern parts of the drainage basin is impacted by potential mixing with a cryptic geothermal source.

The impact of preferential flow on recharge and contaminant transport poses a considerable challenge to water‐resources management. Typical hydrologic models require extensive site characterization, but can underestimate fluxes when preferential flow is significant. A recently developed source‐responsive model incorporates film‐flow theory with conservation of mass to estimate unsaturated‐zone preferential fluxes with readily available data. The term source‐responsive describes the sensitivity of preferential flow in response to water availability at the source of input. We present the first rigorous tests of a parsimonious formulation for simulating water table fluctuations using two case studies, both in arid regions with thick unsaturated zones of fractured volcanic rock. Diffuse flow theory cannot adequately capture the observed water table responses at both sites; the source‐responsive model is a viable alternative. We treat the active area fraction of preferential flow paths as a scaled function of water inputs at the land surface then calibrate the macropore density to fit observed water table rises. Unlike previous applications, we allow the characteristic film‐flow velocity to vary, reflecting the lag time between source and deep water table responses. Analysis of model performance and parameter sensitivity for the two case studies underscores the importance of identifying thresholds for initiation of film flow in unsaturated rocks, and suggests that this parsimonious approach is potentially of great practical value.

The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, collects surface water and groundwater samples at and near the Idaho National Laboratory as part of a routine, site-wide, water-quality monitoring program. Quality-control samples are collected as part of the program to ensure and document the quality of environmental data. From 1996 to 2001, quality-control samples consisting of 204 replicates and 27 blanks were collected at sampling sites. Paired measurements from replicates were used to calculate variability (as reproducibility and reliability) from sample collection and analysis of radiochemical, chemical, and organic constituents. Measurements from field and equipment blanks were used to estimate the potential contamination bias of constituents.

The reproducibility of measurements of constituents was calculated from paired measurements as the normalized absolute difference (NAD) or the relative standard deviation (RSD). The NADs and RSDs, as well as paired measurements with censored or estimated concentrations for which NADs and RSDs were not calculated, were compared to specified criteria to determine if the paired measurements had acceptable reproducibility. If the percentage of paired measurements with acceptable reproducibility for a constituent was greater than or equal to 90 percent, then the reproducibility for that constituent was considered acceptable. The percentage of paired measurements with acceptable reproducibility was greater than or equal to 90 percent for all constituents except orthophosphate (89 percent), zinc (80 percent), hexavalent chromium (53 percent), and total organic carbon (TOC; 38 percent). The low reproducibility for orthophosphate and zinc was attributed to calculation of RSDs for replicates with low concentrations of these constituents. The low reproducibility for hexavalent chromium and TOC was attributed to the inability to preserve hexavalent chromium in water samples and high variability with the analytical method for TOC.

The reliability of measurements of constituents was estimated from pooled RSDs that were calculated for discrete concentration ranges for each constituent. Pooled RSDs of 15 to 33 percent were calculated for low concentrations of gross-beta radioactivity, strontium-90, ammonia, nitrite, orthophosphate, nickel, selenium, zinc, tetrachloroethene, and toluene. Lower pooled RSDs of 0 to 12 percent were calculated for all other concentration ranges of these constituents, and for all other constituents, except for one concentration range for gross-beta radioactivity, chloride, and nitrate + nitrite; two concentration ranges for hexavalent chromium; and TOC. Pooled RSDs for the 50 to 60 picocuries per liter concentration range of gross-beta radioactivity (reported as cesium-137) and the 10 to 60 milligrams per liter (mg/L) concentration range of nitrate + nitrite (reported as nitrogen [N]) were 17 percent. Chloride had a pooled RSD of 14 percent for the 20 to less than 60 mg/L concentration range. High pooled RSDs of 40 and 51 percent were calculated for two concentration ranges for hexavalent chromium and of 60 percent for TOC.

Measurements from (1) field blanks were used to estimate the potential bias associated with environmental samples from sample collection and analysis, (2) equipment blanks were used to estimate the potential bias from cross contamination of samples collected from wells where portable sampling equipment was used, and (3) a source-solution blank was used to verify that the deionized water source-solution was free of the constituents of interest. If more than one measurement was available, the bias was estimated using order statistics and the binomial probability distribution. The source-solution blank had a detectable concentration of hexavalent chromium of 2 micrograms per liter. If this bias was from a source other than the source solution, then about 84 percent of the 117 hexavalent chromium measurements from environmental samples could have a bias of 10 percent or more. Of the 14 field blanks that were collected, only chloride (0.2 milligrams per liter) and ammonia (0.03 milligrams per liter as nitrogen), in one blank each, had detectable concentrations. With an estimated confidence level of 95 percent, at least 80 percent of the 1,987 chloride concentrations measured from all environmental samples had a potential bias of less than 8 percent. The ammonia bias, which may have occurred at the analytical laboratory, could produce a potential bias of 5–100 percent in eight potentially affected ammonia measurements. Of the 11 equipment blanks that were collected, chloride was detected in 4 of these blanks, sodium in 3 blanks, and sulfate and hexavalent chromium were each detected in 1 blank. The concentration of hexavalent chromium in the equipment blank was the same concentration as in the source-solution blank collected on the same day, which indicates that the hexavalent chromium in the equipment blank is probably from a source other than the portable sampling equipment, such as the sample bottles or the source-solution water itself. The potential bias for chloride, sodium, and sulfate measurements was estimated for environmental samples that were collected using portable sampling equipment. For chloride, it was estimated with 93 percent confidence that at least 80 percent of the measurements had a bias of less than 18 percent. For sodium and sulfate, it was estimated with 91 percent confidence that at least 70 percent of the measurements had a bias of less than 12 and 5 percent, respectively.

The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, analyzed water-quality data collected from 67 aquifer wells and 7 surface-water sites at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) from 1949 through 2009. The data analyzed included major cations, anions, nutrients, trace elements, and total organic carbon. The analyses were performed to examine water-quality trends that might inform future management decisions about the number of wells to sample at the INL and the type of constituents to monitor. Water-quality trends were determined using (1) the nonparametric Kendall’s tau correlation coefficient, p-value, Theil-Sen slope estimator, and summary statistics for uncensored data; and (2) the Kaplan-Meier method for calculating summary statistics, Kendall’s tau correlation coefficient, p-value, and Akritas-Theil-Sen slope estimator for robust linear regression for censored data.

Statistical analyses for chloride concentrations indicate that groundwater influenced by Big Lost River seepage has decreasing chloride trends or, in some cases, has variable chloride concentration changes that correlate with above-average and below-average periods of recharge. Analyses of trends for chloride in water samples from four sites located along the Big Lost River indicate a decreasing trend or no trend for chloride, and chloride concentrations generally are much lower at these four sites than those in the aquifer. Above-average and below-average periods of recharge also affect concentration trends for sodium, sulfate, nitrate, and a few trace elements in several wells. Analyses of trends for constituents in water from several of the wells that is mostly regionally derived groundwater generally indicate increasing trends for chloride, sodium, sulfate, and nitrate concentrations. These increases are attributed to agricultural or other anthropogenic influences on the aquifer upgradient of the INL.

Statistical trends of chemical constituents from several wells near the Naval Reactors Facility may be influenced by wastewater disposal at the facility or by anthropogenic influence from the Little Lost River basin. Groundwater samples from three wells downgradient of the Power Burst Facility area show increasing trends for chloride, nitrate, sodium, and sulfate concentrations. The increases could be caused by wastewater disposal in the Power Burst Facility area.

Some groundwater samples in the southwestern part of the INL and southwest of the INL show concentration trends for chloride and sodium that may be influenced by wastewater disposal. Some of the groundwater samples have decreasing trends that could be attributed to the decreasing concentrations in the wastewater from the late 1970s to 2009. The young fraction of groundwater in many of the wells is more than 20 years old, so samples collected in the early 1990s are more representative of groundwater discharged in the 1960s and 1970s, when concentrations in wastewater were much higher. Groundwater sampled in 2009 would be representative of the lower concentrations of chloride and sodium in wastewater discharged in the late 1980s. Analyses of trends for sodium in several groundwater samples from the central and southern part of the eastern Snake River aquifer show increasing trends. In most cases, however, the sodium concentrations are less than background concentrations measured in the aquifer. Many of the wells are open to larger mixed sections of the aquifer, and the increasing trends may indicate that the long history of wastewater disposal in the central part of the INL is increasing sodium concentrations in the groundwater.

## FisherOthers2012

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, evaluated a three-dimensional model of groundwater flow in the fractured basalts and interbedded sediments of the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer at and near the Idaho National Laboratory to determine if model-derived estimates of groundwater movement are consistent with (1) results from previous studies on water chemistry type, (2) the geochemical mixing at an example well, and (3) independently derived estimates of the average linear groundwater velocity. Simulated steady-state flow fields were analyzed using backward particle-tracking simulations that were based on a modified version of the particle tracking program MODPATH. Model results were compared to the 5-microgram-per-liter lithium contour interpreted to represent the transition from a water type that is primarily composed of tributary valley underflow and streamflow-infiltration recharge to a water type primarily composed of regional aquifer water. This comparison indicates several shortcomings in the way the model represents flow in the aquifer. The eastward movement of tributary valley underflow and streamflow-infiltration recharge is overestimated in the north-central part of the model area and underestimated in the central part of the model area. Model inconsistencies can be attributed to large contrasts in hydraulic conductivity between hydrogeologic zones.

Sources of water at well NPR-W01 were identified using backward particle tracking, and they were compared to the relative percentages of source water chemistry determined using geochemical mass balance and mixing models. The particle tracking results compare reasonably well with the chemistry results for groundwater derived from surface-water sources (–28 percent error), but overpredict the proportion of groundwater derived from regional aquifer water (108 percent error) and underpredict the proportion of groundwater derived from tributary valley underflow from the Little Lost River valley (–74 percent error). These large discrepancies may be attributed to large contrasts in hydraulic conductivity between hydrogeologic zones and (or) a short-circuiting of underflow from the Little Lost River valley to an area of high hydraulic conductivity.

Independently derived estimates of the average groundwater velocity at 12 well locations within the upper 100 feet of the aquifer were compared to model-derived estimates. Agreement between velocity estimates was good at wells with travel paths located in areas of sediment-rich rock (root-mean-square error [RMSE] = 5.2 feet per day [ft/d]) and poor in areas of sediment-poor rock (RMSE = 26.2 ft/d); simulated velocities in sediment-poor rock were 2.5 to 4.5 times larger than independently derived estimates at wells USGS 1 (less than 14 ft/d) and USGS 100 (less than 21 ft/d). The models overprediction of groundwater velocities in sediment-poor rock may be attributed to large contrasts in hydraulic conductivity and a very large, model-wide estimate of vertical anisotropy (14,800).

This report, prepared in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, summarizes construction, geophysical, and lithologic data collected from about 4,509 feet of core from seven boreholes deepened or drilled by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Project Office, from 2006 to 2009 at the INL. USGS 103, 105, 108, and 131 were deepened and cored from 759 to 1,307 feet, 800 to 1,409 feet, 760 to 1,218 feet, and 808 to 1,239 feet, respectively. Boreholes USGS 135, NRF-15, and NRF-16 were drilled and continuously cored from land surface to 1,198, 759, and 425 feet, respectively. Cores were photographed and digitally logged by using commercially available software. Borehole descriptions summarize location, completion date, and amount and type of core recovered.

## TwiningOthers2012

In 2011, the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, cored and completed borehole USGS 136 for stratigraphic framework analyses and long-term groundwater monitoring of the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer at the Idaho National Laboratory. The borehole was initially cored to a depth of 1,048 feet (ft) below land surface (BLS) to collect core, open-borehole water samples, and geophysical data. After these data were collected, borehole USGS 136 was cemented and backfilled between 560 and 1,048 ft BLS. The final construction of borehole USGS 136 required that the borehole be reamed to allow for installation of 6-inch (in.) diameter carbon-steel casing and 5-in. diameter stainless-steel screen; the screened monitoring interval was completed between 500 and 551 ft BLS. A dedicated pump and water-level access line were placed to allow for aquifer testing, for collecting periodic water samples, and for measuring water levels.

Geophysical and borehole video logs were collected after coring and after the completion of the monitor well. Geophysical logs were examined in conjunction with the borehole core to describe borehole lithology and to identify primary flow paths for groundwater, which occur in intervals of fractured and vesicular basalt.

A single-well aquifer test was used to define hydraulic characteristics for borehole USGS 136 in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer. Specific-capacity, transmissivity, and hydraulic conductivity from the aquifer test were at least 975 gallons per minute per foot, 1.4×10<sup>5</sup> feet squared per day (ft<sup>2</sup>/d), and 254 feet per day, respectively. The amount of measurable drawdown during the aquifer test was about 0.02 ft. The transmissivity for borehole USGS 136 was in the range of values determined from previous aquifer tests conducted in other wells near the Advanced Test Reactor Complex: 9.5×10<sup>3</sup> to 1.9×10<sup>5</sup> ft<sup>2</sup>/d.

Water samples were analyzed for cations, anions, metals, nutrients, total organic carbon, volatile organic compounds, stable isotopes, and radionuclides. Water samples from borehole USGS 136 indicated that concentrations of tritium, sulfate, and chromium were affected by wastewater disposal practices at the Advanced Test Reactor Complex. Depth-discrete groundwater samples were collected in the open borehole USGS 136 near 965, 710, and 573 ft BLS using a thief sampler; on the basis of selected constituents, deeper groundwater samples showed no influence from wastewater disposal at the Advanced Test Reactor Complex.

During 2009 and 2010, the U.S. Geological Survey’s Idaho National Laboratory Project Office, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, collected quarterly, depth-discrete measurements of fluid pressure and temperature in nine boreholes located in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer. Each borehole was instrumented with a multilevel monitoring system consisting of a series of valved measurement ports, packer bladders, casing segments, and couplers. Multilevel monitoring at the Idaho National Laboratory has been ongoing since 2006. This report summarizes data collected from three multilevel monitoring wells installed during 2009 and 2010 and presents updates to six multilevel monitoring wells. Hydraulic heads (heads) and groundwater temperatures were monitored from 9 multilevel monitoring wells, including 120 hydraulically isolated depth intervals from 448.0 to 1,377.6 feet below land surface.

Quarterly head and temperature profiles reveal unique patterns for vertical examination of the aquifer’s complex basalt and sediment stratigraphy, proximity to aquifer recharge and discharge, and groundwater flow. These features contribute to some of the localized variability even though the general profile shape remained consistent over the period of record. Major inflections in the head profiles almost always coincided with low-permeability sediment layers and occasionally thick sequences of dense basalt. However, the presence of a sediment layer or dense basalt layer was insufficient for identifying the location of a major head change within a borehole without knowing the true areal extent and relative transmissivity of the lithologic unit. Temperature profiles for boreholes completed within the Big Lost Trough indicate linear conductive trends; whereas, temperature profiles for boreholes completed within the axial volcanic high indicate mostly convective heat transfer resulting from the vertical movement of groundwater. Additionally, temperature profiles provide evidence for stratification and mixing of water types along the southern boundary of the Idaho National Laboratory.

Vertical head and temperature change were quantified for each of the nine multilevel monitoring systems. The vertical head gradients were defined for the major inflections in the head profiles and were as high as 2.1 feet per foot. Low vertical head gradients indicated potential vertical connectivity and flow, and large gradient inflections indicated zones of relatively low vertical connectivity. Generally, zones that primarily are composed of fractured basalt displayed relatively small vertical head differences. Large head differences were attributed to poor vertical connectivity between fracture units because of sediment layering and/or dense basalt. Groundwater temperatures in all boreholes ranged from 10.2 to 16.3˚C.

Normalized mean hydraulic head values were analyzed for all nine multilevel monitoring wells for the period of record (2007–10). The mean head values suggest a moderately positive correlation among all boreholes, which reflects regional fluctuations in water levels in response to seasonality. However, the temporal trend is slightly different when the location is considered; wells located along the southern boundary, within the axial volcanic high, show a strongly positive correlation.

Paleomagnetic inclination and polarity studies have been conducted on thousands of subcore samples from 51 coreholes located at and near the Idaho National Laboratory. These studies are used to paleomagnetically characterize and correlate successive stratigraphic intervals in each corehole to similar depth intervals in adjacent coreholes. Paleomagnetic results from 83 surface paleomagnetic sites, within and near the INL, are used to correlate these buried lava flow groups to basaltic shield volcanoes still exposed on the surface of the eastern Snake River Plain. Sample handling and demagnetization protocols are described as well as the paleomagnetic data averaging process. Paleomagnetic inclination comparisons between coreholes located only kilometers apart show comparable stratigraphic successions of mean inclination values over tens of meters of depth. At greater distance between coreholes, comparable correlation of mean inclination values is less consistent because flow groups may be missing or additional flow groups may be present and found at different depth intervals. Two shallow intersecting cross-sections, A–A’ and B–B’ (oriented southwest-northeast and northwest-southeast, respectively), drawn through southwest Idaho National Laboratory coreholes show the corehole to corehole or surface to corehole correlations derived from the paleomagnetic inclination data.

From stratigraphic top to bottom, key results included the (1) Quaking Aspen Butte flow group, which erupted from Quaking Aspen Butte southwest of the Idaho National Laboratory, flowed northeast, and has been found in the subsurface in corehole USGS 132; (2) Vent 5206 flow group, which erupted near the southwestern border of the Idaho National Laboratory, flowed north and east, and has been found in the subsurface in coreholes USGS 132, USGS 129, USGS 131, USGS 127, USGS 130, USGS 128, and STF-AQ-01; and (3) Mid Butte flow group, which erupted north of U.S. Highway 20, flowed northwest, and has been found in the subsurface at coreholes ARA-COR-005 and STF-AQ-01. The high K20 flow group erupted from a vent that may now be buried south of U.S. Highway 20 near Middle Butte, flowed north, and is found in the subsurface in coreholes USGS 131, USGS 127, USGS 130, USGS 128, USGS 123, STF-AQ-01, and ARA-COR-005 ending near the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center. The vent 5252 flow group erupted just south of U.S. Highway 20 near Middle and East Buttes, flowed northwest, and is found in the subsurface in coreholes ARA-COR-005, STF-AQ-01, USGS 130, USGS 128, ICPP 214, USGS 123, ICPP 023, USGS 121, USGS 127, and USGS 131. The Big Lost flow group erupted from a now-buried vent near the Radioactive Waste Management Complex, flowed southwest to corehole USGS 135, and northeast to coreholes USGS 132, USGS 129, USGS 131, USGS 127, USGS 130, STF-AQ-01, and ARA-COR-005. The AEC Butte flow group erupted from AEC Butte near the Advanced Test Reactor Complex and flowed south to corehole Middle 1823, northwest to corehole USGS 134, northeast to coreholes USGS 133 and NRF 7P, and south to coreholes USGS 121, ICPP 023, USGS 123, and USGS 128.

Evidence of progressive subsidence of the axial zone of the ESRP is shown in these cross-sections, distorting the original attitudes of the lava flow groups and interbedded sediments. A deeper cross-section, C–C’ (oriented west to east), spanning the entire southern Idaho National Laboratory shows correlations of the lava flow groups in the saturated part of the ESRP aquifer.

Areally extensive flow groups in the deep subsurface (from about 100–800 meters below land surface) can be traced over long distances. In cross-section C–C’, the flow group labeled “Matuyama” can be correlated from corehole USGS 135 to corehole NPR Test/W-02, a distance of about 28 kilometers (17 miles). The flow group labeled “Matuyama 1.21 Ma” can be correlated from corehole Middle 1823 to corehole ANL-OBS-A-001, a distance of 26 kilometers (16 miles). Other flow groups correlate over distances of up to about 18 kilometers (11 miles).

During 2007 and 2008, the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, collected quarterly depth-discrete measurements of fluid pressure and temperature in six boreholes located in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer of Idaho. Each borehole was instrumented with a multilevel monitoring system consisting of a series of valved measurement ports, packer bladders, casing segments, and couplers. Hydraulic heads (head) and water temperatures in boreholes were monitored at 86 hydraulically-isolated depth intervals located 448.0 to 1,377.6 feet below land surface. The calculation of head is most sensitive to fluid pressure and the altitude of the pressure transducer at each port coupling; it is least sensitive to barometric pressure and water temperature. An analysis of errors associated with the head calculation determined the accuracy of an individual head measurement at ±2.3 feet. Many of the sources of measurement error are diminished when considering the differences between two closely-spaced readings of head; therefore, a ±0.1 foot measurement accuracy was assumed for vertical head differences (and gradients) calculated between adjacent monitoring zones.

Vertical head and temperature profiles were unique to each borehole, and were characteristic of the heterogeneity and anisotropy of the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer. The vertical hydraulic gradients in each borehole remained relatively constant over time with minimum Pearson correlation coefficients between head profiles ranging from 0.72 at borehole USGS 103 to 1.00 at boreholes USGS 133 and MIDDLE 2051. Major inflections in the head profiles almost always coincided with low permeability sediment layers. The presence of a sediment layer, however, was insufficient for identifying the location of a major head change in a borehole. The vertical hydraulic gradients were defined for the major inflections in the head profiles and were as much as 2.2 feet per foot. Head gradients generally were downward in boreholes USGS 133, 134, and MIDDLE 2050A, zero in boreholes USGS 103 and 132, and exhibited a reversal in direction in borehole MIDDLE 2051. Water temperatures in all boreholes ranged from 10.2 to 16.3 degrees Celsius. Boreholes USGS 103 and 132 are in an area of concentrated volcanic vents and fissures, and measurements show water temperature decreasing with depth. All other measurements in boreholes show water temperature increasing with depth. A comparison among boreholes of the normalized mean head over time indicates a moderately positive correlation.

Waste byproducts associated with operations at the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC) have the potential to contaminate the eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP) aquifer. Recharge to the ESRP aquifer is controlled largely by the alternating stratigraphy of fractured volcanic rocks and sedimentary interbeds within the overlying vadose zone and by the availability of water at the surface. Beneath the INTEC facilities, localized zones of saturation perched on the sedimentary interbeds are of particular concern because they may facilitate accelerated transport of contaminants. The sources and timing of natural and anthropogenic recharge to the perched zones are poorly understood. Simple approaches for quantitative characterization of this complex, variably saturated flow system are needed to assess potential scenarios for contaminant transport under alternative remediation strategies. During 2009–2011, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, employed data analysis and numerical simulations with a recently developed model of preferential flow to evaluate the sources and quantity of recharge to the perched zones. Piezometer, tensiometer, temperature, precipitation, and stream-discharge data were analyzed, with particular focus on the possibility of contributions to the perched zones from snowmelt and flow in the neighboring Big Lost River (BLR). Analysis of the timing and magnitude of subsurface dynamics indicate that streamflow provides local recharge to the shallow, intermediate, and deep perched saturated zones within 150 m of the BLR; at greater distances from the BLR the influence of streamflow on recharge is unclear. Perched water-level dynamics in most wells analyzed are consistent with findings from previous geochemical analyses, which suggest that a combination of annual snowmelt and anthropogenic sources (for example, leaky pipes and drainage ditches) contribute to recharge of shallow and intermediate perched zones throughout much of INTEC. The source-responsive fluxes model was parameterized to simulate recharge via preferential flow associated with intermittent episodes of streamflow in the BLR. The simulations correspond reasonably well to the observed hydrologic response within the shallow perched zone. Good model performance indicates that source-responsive flow through a limited number of connected fractures contributes substantially to the perched-zone dynamics. The agreement between simulated and observed perched-zone dynamics suggest that the source-responsive fluxes model can provide a valuable tool for quantifying rapid preferential flow processes that may result from different land management scenarios.

In September 2010, a research consortium led by scientists from Utah State University began drilling the first of three continuously cored boreholes on the Snake River Plain in southern Idaho. The goals of this effort, the Snake River Scientific Drilling Project, are to study the interaction between the Earth's crust and mantle, to identify potential geothermal energy sources, and to track the evolution of the Yellowstone hotspot on the Snake River Plain.

The first borehole, located near Kimama, Idaho, is about 50 miles southwest of the U.S. Department of Energy's Idaho National Laboratory. Because geohydrologic data are scarce for that area of the central Snake River Plain, the Kimama borehole, completed in January 2011, provided a unique opportunity to collect geophysical and water-chemistry data from the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer system, downgradient of the laboratory. Therefore, in conjunction with the Snake River Scientific Drilling Project, scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey's Idaho National Laboratory Project Office conducted geophysical logging and collected water samples at the Kimama site. Wireline geophysical logs were collected for the diverging borehole, Kimama-1A and -1B, from land surface to 976 and 2,498 feet below land surface (BLS), respectively. Water samples were collected from Kimama-1A at depths near 460 and 830 feet BLS, and from the Kimama Water Supply (KWS) well located about 75 feet away.

Geophysical log data included a composite of natural gamma, neutron, gamma-gamma dual density, and gyroscopic analysis for boreholes Kimama-1A and -1B. Geophysical logs depicted eight sediment layers (excluding surficial sediment) ranging from 4 to 60 feet in thickness. About 155 individual basalt flows were identified, ranging from less than 3 feet to more than 175 feet in thickness (averaging 15 feet) for borehole Kimama-1B (0 to 2,498 feet BLS). Sediment and basalt contacts were selected based on geophysical traces and were confirmed with visual inspection of core photographs. Temperature logs from the water table surface (about 260 feet BLS) to the bottom of borehole Kimama-1B (2,498 feet BLS) were nearly isothermal, ranging from about 62 to 64 degrees Fahrenheit. Gyroscopic data revealed that borehole Kimama-1B begins to separate from borehole Kimama-1A near a depth of 676 feet BLS. Drillhole azimuth and horizontal deviation at total logged depth for boreholes Kimama-1A and -1B were 172.6 and 188.3 degrees and 25.9 and 82.0 feet, respectively.

Water samples were collected and analyzed for common ions; selected trace elements; nutrients; isotopes of hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon; and selected radionuclides. One set of water samples was collected from the KWS well and the two other sample sets were collected from borehole Kimama-1A near 460 and 830 feet BLS. With one exception, data for all three zones sampled near Kimama generally indicated that the water chemistry was similar. The exception was found in the deepest zone in borehole Kimama-1A (830 feet BLS) where concentrations probably were affected by the drilling mud. A comparison of the inorganic, organic, and stable chemistry data between the KWS well and the 460-foot zone in borehole Kimama-1A indicated similar chemistry of the aquifer water, except for some variability with nitrate plus nitrite, orthophosphate, iron, zinc, and carbon-14. Radionuclide concentrations were either less than reporting levels or at background levels for the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer.

Three-dimensional steady-state and transient models of groundwater flow and advective transport in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer were developed by the U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy. The steady-state and transient flow models cover an area of 1,940 square miles that includes most of the 890 square miles of the Idaho National Laboratory (INL). A 50-year history of waste disposal at the INL has resulted in measurable concentrations of waste contaminants in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer. Model results can be used in numerical simulations to evaluate the movement of contaminants in the aquifer.

Saturated flow in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer was simulated using the MODFLOW-2000 groundwater flow model. Steady-state flow was simulated to represent conditions in 1980 with average streamflow infiltration from 1966–80 for the Big Lost River, the major variable inflow to the system. The transient flow model simulates groundwater flow between 1980 and 1995, a period that included a 5-year wet cycle (1982–86) followed by an 8-year dry cycle (1987–94). Specified flows into or out of the active model grid define the conditions on all boundaries except the southwest (outflow) boundary, which is simulated with head-dependent flow. In the transient flow model, streamflow infiltration was the major stress, and was variable in time and location. The models were calibrated by adjusting aquifer hydraulic properties to match simulated and observed heads or head differences using the parameter-estimation program incorporated in MODFLOW-2000. Various summary, regression, and inferential statistics, in addition to comparisons of model properties and simulated head to measured properties and head, were used to evaluate the model calibration.

Model parameters estimated for the steady-state calibration included hydraulic conductivity for seven of nine hydrogeologic zones and a global value of vertical anisotropy. Parameters estimated for the transient calibration included specific yield for five of the seven hydrogeologic zones. The zones represent five rock units and parts of four rock units with abundant interbedded sediment. All estimates of hydraulic conductivity were nearly within 2 orders of magnitude of the maximum expected value in a range that exceeds 6 orders of magnitude. The estimate of vertical anisotropy was larger than the maximum expected value. All estimates of specific yield and their confidence intervals were within the ranges of values expected for aquifers, the range of values for porosity of basalt, and other estimates of specific yield for basalt.

The steady-state model reasonably simulated the observed water-table altitude, orientation, and gradients. Simulation of transient flow conditions accurately reproduced observed changes in the flow system resulting from episodic infiltration from the Big Lost River and facilitated understanding and visualization of the relative importance of historical differences in infiltration in time and space. As described in a conceptual model, the numerical model simulations demonstrate flow that is (1) dominantly horizontal through interflow zones in basalt and vertical anisotropy resulting from contrasts in hydraulic conductivity of various types of basalt and the interbedded sediments, (2) temporally variable due to streamflow infiltration from the Big Lost River, and (3) moving downward downgradient of the INL.

The numerical models were reparameterized, recalibrated, and analyzed to evaluate alternative conceptualizations or implementations of the conceptual model. The analysis of the reparameterized models revealed that little improvement in the model could come from alternative descriptions of sediment content, simulated aquifer thickness, streamflow infiltration, and vertical head distribution on the downgradient boundary. Of the alternative estimates of flow to or from the aquifer, only a 20 percent decrease in the largest inflow, the northeast boundary underflow, resulted in a recalibrated parameter value just outside the confidence interval of the base-case calibrated value.

Particle-tracking calculations using the particle-tracking program MODPATH were used to evaluate (1) how simulated groundwater flow paths and travel times differ between the steady-state and transient flow models, (2) how wet- and dry-climate cycles affect groundwater flow paths and travel times, and (3) how well model-derived groundwater flow directions and velocities compare to independently derived estimates. Particle tracking also was used to simulate the growth of tritium (3H) plumes originating at the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center and the Reactor Technology Complex over a 16-year period under steady‑state and transient flow conditions (1953–68). The shape, dimensions, and areal extent of the 3H plumes were compared to a map of the plumes for 1968 from 3H releases at the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center and the Reactor Technology Complex beginning in 1952.

Collectively, the particle-tracking simulations indicate that average linear groundwater velocities, based on estimates of porosity, and flow paths are influenced by two primary factors: (1) the dynamic character of the water table and (2) the large contrasts in the hydraulic properties of the media, primarily hydraulic conductivity. The simulated growth and decay of groundwater mounds as much as 34 ft above the steady-state water table beneath the Big Lost River spreading areas, sinks, and playas, and to a lesser extent beneath the Big Lost River channel lead to non-uniform changes in the altitude of the water table throughout the model area. These changes affect the orientation and magnitude of water-table gradients and affect groundwater flow directions and velocities to a greater or lesser degree depending on the magnitude, duration, and proximity of the transient stress. Simulation results also indicate that temporal changes in the local hydraulic gradient can account for some of the observed dispersion of contaminants in the aquifer near the major sources of contamination at the INTEC and the RTC and perhaps most observed dispersion several miles downgradient of these facilities. The distance downgradient of the INTEC that simulated particle plumes were able to reasonably reproduce the shape and dimensions of the 1968 3H plume extended only to the boundary of zones of abundant sediment, about 4 miles downgradient of the INTEC. This boundary encompasses the entire area represented by the 1968 25,000 picocuries/liter 3H isopleths. Particle plumes simulated beyond this boundary were narrow and long, and did not reasonably reproduce the shape, dimensions, or position of the leading edge of the 3H plume as shown in earlier reports; however, as noted in an assessment of the interpreted plume, few data were available in 1968 to characterize its true areal extent and shape.

From 2005 to 2008, the U.S. Geological Survey’s Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Project office, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, collected water-quality samples from multiple water-bearing zones in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer. Water samples were collected from six monitoring wells completed in about 350–700 feet of the upper part of the aquifer, and the samples were analyzed for major ions, selected trace elements, nutrients, selected radiochemical constituents, and selected stable isotopes. Each well was equipped with a multilevel monitoring system containing four to seven sampling ports that were each isolated by permanent packer systems. The sampling ports were installed in aquifer zones that were highly transmissive and that represented the water chemistry of the top four to five model layers of a steady-state and transient groundwater-flow model. The model’s water chemistry and particle-tracking simulations are being used to better define movement of wastewater constituents in the aquifer.

The results of the water chemistry analyses indicated that, in each of four separate wells, one zone of water differed markedly from the other zones in the well. In four wells, one zone to as many as five zones contained radiochemical constituents that originated from wastewater disposal at selected laboratory facilities. The multilevel sampling systems are defining the vertical distribution of wastewater constituents in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer and the concentrations of wastewater constituents in deeper zones in wells Middle 2051, USGS 132, and USGS 103 support the concept of groundwater flow deepening in the southwestern part of the INL.

Since 1952, radiochemical and chemical wastewater discharged to infiltration ponds (also called percolation ponds), evaporation ponds, and disposal wells at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has affected water quality in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer and perched groundwater zones underlying the INL. The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, maintains groundwater monitoring networks at the INL to determine hydrologic trends, and to delineate the movement of radiochemical and chemical wastes in the aquifer and in perched groundwater zones. This report presents an analysis of water-level and water-quality data collected from aquifer and perched groundwater wells in the USGS groundwater monitoring networks during 2006–08.

Water in the Snake River Plain aquifer primarily moves through fractures and interflow zones in basalt, generally flows southwestward, and eventually discharges at springs along the Snake River. The aquifer primarily is recharged from infiltration of irrigation water, infiltration of streamflow, groundwater inflow from adjoining mountain drainage basins, and infiltration of precipitation.

From March–May 2005 to March–May 2008, water levels in wells generally remained constant or rose slightly in the southwestern corner of the INL. Water levels declined in the central and northern parts of the INL. The declines ranged from about 1 to 3 feet in the central part of the INL, to as much as 9 feet in the northern part of the INL. Water levels in perched groundwater wells around the Advanced Test Reactor Complex (ATRC) also declined.

Detectable concentrations of radiochemical constituents in water samples from wells in the Snake River Plain aquifer at the INL generally decreased or remained constant during 2006–08. Decreases in concentrations were attributed to decreased rates of radioactive-waste disposal, radioactive decay, changes in waste-disposal methods, and dilution from recharge and underflow. In April or October 2008, reportable concentrations of tritium in groundwater ranged from 810±70 to 8,570±190 picocuries per liter (pCi/L), and the tritium plume extended south-southwestward in the general direction of groundwater flow. Tritium concentrations in water from wells completed in shallow perched groundwater at the ATRC were less than the reporting levels. Tritium concentrations in deep perched groundwater exceeded the reporting level in 11 wells during at least one sampling event during 2006–08 at the ATRC. Tritium concentrations from one or more zones in each well were reportable in water samples collected at various depths in six wells equipped with multi-level WestbayTM packer sampling systems.

Concentrations of strontium-90 in water from 24 of 52 aquifer wells sampled during April or October 2008 exceeded the reporting level. Concentrations ranged from 2.2±0.7 to 32.7±1.2 pCi/L. Strontium-90 has not been detected within the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer beneath the ATRC partly because of the exclusive use of waste-disposal ponds and lined evaporation ponds rather than using the disposal well for radioactive-wastewater disposal at ATRC. At the ATRC, the strontium-90 concentration in water from one well completed in shallow perched groundwater was less than the reporting level. During at least one sampling event during 2006–08, concentrations of strontium-90 in water from nine wells completed in deep perched groundwater at the ATRC were greater than reporting levels. Concentrations ranged from 2.1±0.7 to 70.5±1.8 pCi/L. At the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC), the reporting level was exceeded in water from two wells completed in deep perched groundwater. During 2006–08, concentrations of cesium-137, plutonium-238, and plutonium-239, -240 (undivided), and americium-241 were less than the reporting level in water samples from all wells and all zones in wells equipped with multi-level WestbayTM packer sampling systems at the INL.

The concentration of chromium in water from one well south of the ATRC steadily decreased from 2006 to 2008 and was 93 micrograms per liter (μg/L) in 2008, just less than the maximum contaminant level (MCL). Concentrations in water samples from other wells ranged from 1.2 to 28.3 μg/L. During 2006–08, chromium was detected in one well completed in shallow perched groundwater at a concentration of 3 μg/L. Dissolved chromium was detected in water from 14 wells completed in deep perched groundwater at the ATRC during 2006–08.

Concentrations of sodium in water from wells south of the INTEC during 2006–08 generally were equal to or less than sodium concentrations detected in October 2005, with the exception of concentrations in water from well USGS 47 which was slightly higher in 2008 than in 2005. In October 2008, sodium concentrations in water from two wells near the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC) were 45 and 26 milligrams per liter (mg/L), slightly higher than the October 2005 concentrations. During 2006–08, analyses were not made for dissolved sodium concentrations in shallow perched groundwater at the ATRC. During April or October 2008, dissolved sodium concentrations in water from 16 wells completed in deep perched groundwater ranged from 6 to 23 mg/L; concentration in water from one well was 476 mg/L. The vertical distribution of sodium concentrations in wells equipped with WestbayTM systems were fairly consistent with depth, with the exception of sodium concentrations in water from well USGS 132, which were much higher (26–30 mg/L) in the uppermost zone than in the deeper zones (9–12 mg/L).

Chloride concentrations in water from wells near the INTEC generally decreased since the late 1990s. During 2006–08, concentrations in most wells either generally were constant or increased slightly. Trends in concentrations in water from wells downgradient from the percolation ponds correlated with discharge rates into the ponds when travel time was considered. During 2008, chloride concentrations in water from wells USGS 88 and 89 at the RWMC were 91 and 41 mg/L. Concentrations of chloride in all other wells near the RWMC ranged from 11 to 25 mg/L. In 2008, concentrations in water from all wells at or near the ATRC ranged between 10 and 18 mg/L. During April 2008, dissolved chloride concentrations in shallow perched groundwater near the ATRC ranged from 11 to 13 mg/L; concentrations in deep perched groundwater during April or October 2008 ranged from 4 to 43 mg/L.

In 2008, sulfate concentrations ranged from 40 to 157 mg/L in water samples from nine aquifer wells in the south-central part of the INL, which exceeds the 40-mg/L background concentration of sulfate. The greater-than-background concentrations of sulfate in water from these wells probably resulted from sulfate disposal at the ATRC infiltration ponds. In October and April 2008, sulfate concentrations in water samples from two wells near the RWMC were greater than background levels and could have resulted from the well construction and (or) waste disposal at the RWMC. During 2007–08, sulfate concentrations from three wells southwest of the INTEC were 45, 47, and 46 mg/L. The maximum dissolved sulfate concentration in shallow perched groundwater near the ATRC was 399 mg/L in well CWP 1 in November 2006. During April–October 2008, the maximum concentration of dissolved sulfate in deep perched groundwater was 1,477 mg/L in well USGS 68, which is located west of the chemical-waste pond. Concentrations of sulfate in two wells completed in deep perched groundwater near the INTEC were 36 and 39 mg/L. Overall the vertical distribution of sulfate in water from wells equipped with WestbayTM systems generally was consistent in most zones in wells during 2006–08.

The regional background concentration for nitrate (as N) is about 1 mg/L. In October 2008, concentrations of nitrate (as N) in water from most wells at and near the INTEC exceeded the background concentration and ranged from 2.2 to 5.97 mg/L. Near the ATRC, the concentration of nitrate (as N) in water from well USGS 65 was 1.5 mg/L. In 2008, concentrations of nitrate (as N) in water from wells USGS 88, 89, and 119 were 0.9, 1.7, and 1.4 mg/L, respectively. All concentrations measured in aquifer wells at the INL in 2008 were less than the MCL for drinking water of 10 mg/L as N, with the exception of a concentration of 18.9 mg/L from well USGS 50 at the INTEC.

During April or October 2008, fluoride concentrations in water samples from four aquifer wells ranged from 0.2 to 0.3 mg/L. These concentrations are similar to the background concentrations, which indicate that wastewater disposal has not appreciably affected fluoride concentrations in the Snake River Plain aquifer near the INTEC.

During 2006–08, water samples from 30 aquifer wells were collected and analyzed for volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Twelve VOCs were detected. Concentrations of from 1 to 10 VOCs were detected in water samples from 11 wells. Primary VOCs detected included carbon tetrachloride, trichloromethane, 1,1-dichloroethane, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, trichloroethylene, and tetrachloroethylene.

During April or October 2008, water samples from 50 wells completed in the Snake River Plain aquifer at the INL were analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC); detected concentrations ranged from 0.43 to 1.9 mg/L.

Well USGS 92 is in the Subsurface Disposal Area (SDA) at the RWMC and is completed in a sedimentary interbed 214 ft below land surface. Perched groundwater in this well has moved through overlying sediments and basalt, and may contain waste constituents leached from radiochemical and organic chemical wastes buried in the SDA. During 2006–08, tritium concentrations in water samples from well USGS 92 exceeded the reporting level and ranged from 490±110 pCi/L in April 2006 to 300±80 pCi/L in June 2008. Water from well USGS 92 was sampled for VOCs in April 2007, and 9 VOCs were detected which was a decrease from the 15 compounds detected in 2002–03. Additionally, all VOC concentrations detected in 2007 were significantly lower than those detected during 2002–03, with the exception of toluene, which was not detected in 2002–03.

A new model explicitly incorporates the possibility of rapid response, across significant distance, to substantial water input. It is useful for unsaturated flow processes that are not inherently diffusive, or that do not progress through a series of equilibrium states. The term source-responsive is used to mean that flow responds sensitively to changing conditions at the source of water input (e.g., rainfall, irrigation, or ponded infiltration). The domain of preferential flow can be conceptualized as laminar flow in free-surface films along the walls of pores. These films may be considered to have uniform thickness, as suggested by field evidence that preferential flow moves at an approximately uniform rate when generated by a continuous and ample water supply. An effective facial area per unit volume quantitatively characterizes the medium with respect to source-responsive flow. A flow-intensity factor dependent on conditions within the medium represents the amount of source-responsive flow at a given time and position. Laminar flow theory provides relations for the velocity and thickness of flowing source-responsive films. Combination with the Darcy–Buckingham law and the continuity equation leads to expressions for both fluxes and dynamic water contents. Where preferential flow is sometimes or always significant, the interactive combination of source-responsive and diffuse flow has the potential to improve prediction of unsaturated-zone fluxes in response to hydraulic inputs and the evolving distribution of soil moisture. Examples for which this approach is efficient and physically plausible include (i) rainstorm-generated rapid fluctuations of a deep water table and (ii) space- and time-dependent soil water content response to infiltration in a macroporous soil.

Core from USGS 135, a corehole located on the Eastern Snake River Plain, Idaho, provides a ~1.06 my record of basalt volcanism associated with the Arco-Big Southern Butte volcanic rift zone. Lithologic, geochemical and paleomagnetic data confirm the presence of 14 basalt flowgroups and 116 flow units. The predominance of proximal-facies flow units and accumulation rates calculated since 780 ka demonstrate periods of intense volcanic activity. A hiatus of more than 200 ka has followed the emplacement of the last flowgroup at ~352 ka.

Variations in major and trace element concentrations and paleomagnetic inclinations were used to correlate flowgroups between USGS 135 and coreholes to its east and northeast. Regionally persistent Flowgroups E, F, G and H are present in corehole USGS 135, but younger correlative flowgroups are absent. The representation of flowgroups indicates that corehole USGS 135 was differentially offset relative to coreholes to its east.

Since 1952, radiochemical and chemical wastewater discharged to infiltration ponds (also called percolation ponds), evaporation ponds, and disposal wells at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has affected water quality in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer and perched groundwater zones underlying the INL. The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, maintains groundwater monitoring networks at the INL to determine hydrologic trends, and to delineate the movement of radiochemical and chemical wastes in the aquifer and in perched groundwater zones. This report presents an analysis of water-level and water-quality data collected from aquifer and perched groundwater wells in the USGS groundwater monitoring networks during 2006–08.

Water in the Snake River Plain aquifer primarily moves through fractures and interflow zones in basalt, generally flows southwestward, and eventually discharges at springs along the Snake River. The aquifer primarily is recharged from infiltration of irrigation water, infiltration of streamflow, groundwater inflow from adjoining mountain drainage basins, and infiltration of precipitation.

From March–May 2005 to March–May 2008, water levels in wells generally remained constant or rose slightly in the southwestern corner of the INL. Water levels declined in the central and northern parts of the INL. The declines ranged from about 1 to 3 feet in the central part of the INL, to as much as 9 feet in the northern part of the INL. Water levels in perched groundwater wells around the Advanced Test Reactor Complex (ATRC) also declined.

Detectable concentrations of radiochemical constituents in water samples from wells in the Snake River Plain aquifer at the INL generally decreased or remained constant during 2006–08. Decreases in concentrations were attributed to decreased rates of radioactive-waste disposal, radioactive decay, changes in waste-disposal methods, and dilution from recharge and underflow. In April or October 2008, reportable concentrations of tritium in groundwater ranged from 810±70 to 8,570±190 picocuries per liter (pCi/L), and the tritium plume extended south-southwestward in the general direction of groundwater flow. Tritium concentrations in water from wells completed in shallow perched groundwater at the ATRC were less than the reporting levels. Tritium concentrations in deep perched groundwater exceeded the reporting level in 11 wells during at least one sampling event during 2006–08 at the ATRC. Tritium concentrations from one or more zones in each well were reportable in water samples collected at various depths in six wells equipped with multi-level WestbayTM packer sampling systems.

Concentrations of strontium-90 in water from 24 of 52 aquifer wells sampled during April or October 2008 exceeded the reporting level. Concentrations ranged from 2.2±0.7 to 32.7±1.2 pCi/L. Strontium-90 has not been detected within the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer beneath the ATRC partly because of the exclusive use of waste-disposal ponds and lined evaporation ponds rather than using the disposal well for radioactive-wastewater disposal at ATRC. At the ATRC, the strontium-90 concentration in water from one well completed in shallow perched groundwater was less than the reporting level. During at least one sampling event during 2006–08, concentrations of strontium-90 in water from nine wells completed in deep perched groundwater at the ATRC were greater than reporting levels. Concentrations ranged from 2.1±0.7 to 70.5±1.8 pCi/L. At the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC), the reporting level was exceeded in water from two wells completed in deep perched groundwater. During 2006–08, concentrations of cesium-137, plutonium-238, and plutonium-239, -240 (undivided), and americium-241 were less than the reporting level in water samples from all wells and all zones in wells equipped with multi-level WestbayTM packer sampling systems at the INL.

The concentration of chromium in water from one well south of the ATRC steadily decreased from 2006 to 2008 and was 93 micrograms per liter (μg/L) in 2008, just less than the maximum contaminant level (MCL). Concentrations in water samples from other wells ranged from 1.2 to 28.3 μg/L. During 2006–08, chromium was detected in one well completed in shallow perched groundwater at a concentration of 3 μg/L. Dissolved chromium was detected in water from 14 wells completed in deep perched groundwater at the ATRC during 2006–08.

Concentrations of sodium in water from wells south of the INTEC during 2006–08 generally were equal to or less than sodium concentrations detected in October 2005, with the exception of concentrations in water from well USGS 47 which was slightly higher in 2008 than in 2005. In October 2008, sodium concentrations in water from two wells near the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC) were 45 and 26 milligrams per liter (mg/L), slightly higher than the October 2005 concentrations. During 2006–08, analyses were not made for dissolved sodium concentrations in shallow perched groundwater at the ATRC. During April or October 2008, dissolved sodium concentrations in water from 16 wells completed in deep perched groundwater ranged from 6 to 23 mg/L; concentration in water from one well was 476 mg/L. The vertical distribution of sodium concentrations in wells equipped with WestbayTM systems were fairly consistent with depth, with the exception of sodium concentrations in water from well USGS 132, which were much higher (26–30 mg/L) in the uppermost zone than in the deeper zones (9–12 mg/L).

Chloride concentrations in water from wells near the INTEC generally decreased since the late 1990s. During 2006–08, concentrations in most wells either generally were constant or increased slightly. Trends in concentrations in water from wells downgradient from the percolation ponds correlated with discharge rates into the ponds when travel time was considered. During 2008, chloride concentrations in water from wells USGS 88 and 89 at the RWMC were 91 and 41 mg/L. Concentrations of chloride in all other wells near the RWMC ranged from 11 to 25 mg/L. In 2008, concentrations in water from all wells at or near the ATRC ranged between 10 and 18 mg/L. During April 2008, dissolved chloride concentrations in shallow perched groundwater near the ATRC ranged from 11 to 13 mg/L; concentrations in deep perched groundwater during April or October 2008 ranged from 4 to 43 mg/L.

In 2008, sulfate concentrations ranged from 40 to 157 mg/L in water samples from nine aquifer wells in the south-central part of the INL, which exceeds the 40-mg/L background concentration of sulfate. The greater-than-background concentrations of sulfate in water from these wells probably resulted from sulfate disposal at the ATRC infiltration ponds. In October and April 2008, sulfate concentrations in water samples from two wells near the RWMC were greater than background levels and could have resulted from the well construction and (or) waste disposal at the RWMC. During 2007–08, sulfate concentrations from three wells southwest of the INTEC were 45, 47, and 46 mg/L. The maximum dissolved sulfate concentration in shallow perched groundwater near the ATRC was 399 mg/L in well CWP 1 in November 2006. During April–October 2008, the maximum concentration of dissolved sulfate in deep perched groundwater was 1,477 mg/L in well USGS 68, which is located west of the chemical-waste pond. Concentrations of sulfate in two wells completed in deep perched groundwater near the INTEC were 36 and 39 mg/L. Overall the vertical distribution of sulfate in water from wells equipped with WestbayTM systems generally was consistent in most zones in wells during 2006–08.

The regional background concentration for nitrate (as N) is about 1 mg/L. In October 2008, concentrations of nitrate (as N) in water from most wells at and near the INTEC exceeded the background concentration and ranged from 2.2 to 5.97 mg/L. Near the ATRC, the concentration of nitrate (as N) in water from well USGS 65 was 1.5 mg/L. In 2008, concentrations of nitrate (as N) in water from wells USGS 88, 89, and 119 were 0.9, 1.7, and 1.4 mg/L, respectively. All concentrations measured in aquifer wells at the INL in 2008 were less than the MCL for drinking water of 10 mg/L as N, with the exception of a concentration of 18.9 mg/L from well USGS 50 at the INTEC.

During April or October 2008, fluoride concentrations in water samples from four aquifer wells ranged from 0.2 to 0.3 mg/L. These concentrations are similar to the background concentrations, which indicate that wastewater disposal has not appreciably affected fluoride concentrations in the Snake River Plain aquifer near the INTEC.

During 2006–08, water samples from 30 aquifer wells were collected and analyzed for volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Twelve VOCs were detected. Concentrations of from 1 to 10 VOCs were detected in water samples from 11 wells. Primary VOCs detected included carbon tetrachloride, trichloromethane, 1,1-dichloroethane, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, trichloroethylene, and tetrachloroethylene.

During April or October 2008, water samples from 50 wells completed in the Snake River Plain aquifer at the INL were analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC); detected concentrations ranged from 0.43 to 1.9 mg/L.

Well USGS 92 is in the Subsurface Disposal Area (SDA) at the RWMC and is completed in a sedimentary interbed 214 ft below land surface. Perched groundwater in this well has moved through overlying sediments and basalt, and may contain waste constituents leached from radiochemical and organic chemical wastes buried in the SDA. During 2006–08, tritium concentrations in water samples from well USGS 92 exceeded the reporting level and ranged from 490±110 pCi/L in April 2006 to 300±80 pCi/L in June 2008. Water from well USGS 92 was sampled for VOCs in April 2007, and 9 VOCs were detected which was a decrease from the 15 compounds detected in 2002–03. Additionally, all VOC concentrations detected in 2007 were significantly lower than those detected during 2002–03, with the exception of toluene, which was not detected in 2002–03.

From 1953 to 1988, wastewater containing approximately 0.94 curies of iodine-129 (<sup>129</sup>I) was generated at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) in southeastern Idaho. Almost all of this wastewater was discharged at or near the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC) on the INL site. Most of the wastewater was discharged directly into the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer through a deep disposal well until 1984; however, some wastewater also was discharged into unlined infiltration ponds or leaked from distribution systems below the INTEC.

In 2003, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, collected samples for <sup>129</sup>I from 36 wells used to monitor the Snake River Plain aquifer, and from one well used to monitor a perched zone at the INTEC. Concentrations of <sup>129</sup>I in the aquifer ranged from 0.0000066±0.0000002 to 0.72±0.051 picocuries per liter (pCi/L). Many wells within a 3-mile radius of the INTEC showed decreases of as much as one order of magnitude in concentration from samples collected during 1990–91, and all of the samples had concentrations less than the Environmental Protection Agency’s Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of 1 pCi/L. The average concentration of <sup>129</sup>I in 19 wells sampled during both collection periods decreased from 0.975 pCi/L in 1990–91 to 0.249 pCi/L in 2003. These decreases are attributed to the discontinuation of disposal of <sup>129</sup>I in wastewater after 1988 and to dilution and dispersion in the aquifer.

Although water from wells sampled in 2003 near the INTEC showed decreases in concentrations of <sup>129</sup>I compared with data collected in 1990–91, some wells south and east of the Central Facilities Area, near the site boundary, and south of the INL showed slight increases. These slight increases may be related to variable discharge rates of wastewater that eventually moved to these well locations as a mass of water from a particular disposal period.

In 2007, the USGS collected samples for <sup>129</sup>I from 36 wells that are used to monitor the aquifer south of INTEC and from 2 wells that are used to monitor perched zones at INTEC. Concentrations of <sup>129</sup>I in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer ranged from 0.000026±0.000002 to 1.16±0.04 pCi/L, and the concentration at one well exceeded the maximum contaminant level (1 pCi/L) for public drinking water supplies. The average concentration of 19 wells sampled in 2003 and 2007 did not differ; however, slight increases and decreases of concentrations in several areas around the INTEC were evident in the aquifer. The decreases are attributed to the discontinued disposal and to dilution and dispersion in the aquifer. The increases may be due to the movement into the aquifer of remnant perched water below the INTEC.

In 2007, the USGS also collected samples from 31 zones in 6 wells equipped with multi-level WestbayTM packer sampling systems to help define the vertical distribution of <sup>129</sup>I in the aquifer. Concentrations ranged from 0.000011±0.0000005 to 0.0167±0.0007 pCi/L. For three wells, concentrations of <sup>129</sup>I between zones varied one to two orders of magnitude. For two wells, concentrations varied for one zone by more than an order of magnitude from the wells’ other zones. Similar concentrations were measured from all five zones sampled in one well. All of the 31 zones had concentrations two or more magnitudes below the maximum contaminant level.

SHRIMP analysis of U/Pb ages of detrital zircons in twelve late Miocene to Pleistocene sand samples from six drill cores on the Snake River Plain (SRP), Idaho, suggests that an ancestral Lost River system was drained westward along the northern side of the SRP. Neoproterozoic (650 to 740 Ma, Cryogenian) detrital zircon grains from the Wildhorse Creek drainage of the Pioneer Mountains core complex, with a source in 695 Ma orthogneiss, and which are characteristic of the Big Lost River system, are found in Pliocene sand from cores drilled in the central SRP (near Wendell) and western SRP (at Mountain Home). In addition to these Neoproterozoic grains, fluvial sands sourced from the northern margin of the SRP contain detrital zircons with the following ages: 42 to 52 Ma from the Challis magmatic belt, 80 to 100 Ma from the Atlanta lobe of the Idaho batholith, and mixed Paleozoic and Proterozoic ages (1400 to 2000 Ma). In contrast, sands in the Mountain Home Air Base well (MHAB) that contain 155-Ma Jurassic detrital grains with a source in northern Nevada are interpreted to represent an integrated Snake River, with provenance on the southern, eastern and northern sides of the SRP.

We propose that late Pliocene and early Pleistocene construction of basaltic volcanoes and rhyolitic domes of the Axial Volcanic Zone of the eastern SRP and the northwest-trending Arco Volcanic Rift Zone (including the Craters of the Moon volcanic center), disrupted the paleo-Lost River drainage, confining it to the Big Lost Trough, a volcanically dammed basin of internal drainage on the Idaho National Laboratory (INL). After the Axial Volcanic Zone and Arco Volcanic Rift Zone were constructed to form a volcanic eruptive and intrusive highland to the southwest, sediment from the Big Lost River was trapped in the Big Lost Trough instead of being delivered by surface streams to the western SRP. Today, water from drainages north of the SRP enters the Snake River Plain regional aquifer through sinks in the Big Lost Trough, and the water resurfaces at Thousand Springs, Idaho, about 195 km to the southwest.

Holocene to latest Pliocene samples from drill core in the Big Lost Trough reveal interplay between the glacio-fluvial outwash of the voluminous Big Lost River system and the relatively minor Little Lost River system. A mixed provenance signature is recognized in fine-grained sands deposited in a highstand of a Pleistocene pluvial-lake system.

Radiochemical and chemical wastewater discharged since 1952 to infiltration ponds, evaporation ponds, and disposal wells at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has affected water quality in the Snake River Plain aquifer and perched-water zones underlying the INL. The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, maintains ground-water monitoring networks at the INL to determine hydrologic trends, and to delineate the movement of radiochemical and chemical wastes in the aquifer and in perched-water zones. This report presents an analysis of water-level and water-quality data collected from aquifer and perched-water wells in the USGS ground-water monitoring networks during 2002–05.

Water in the Snake River Plain aquifer primarily moves through fractures and interflow zones in basalt, generally flows southwestward, and eventually discharges at springs along the Snake River. The aquifer is recharged primarily from infiltration of irrigation water, infiltration of streamflow, ground-water inflow from adjoining mountain drainage basins, and infiltration of precipitation.

From March–May 2001 to March–May 2005, water levels in wells declined throughout the INL area. The declines ranged from about 3 to 8 feet in the southwestern part of the INL, about 10 to 15 feet in the west central part of the INL, and about 6 to 11 feet in the northern part of the INL. Water levels in perched water wells declined also, with the water level dropping below the bottom of the pump in many wells during 2002–05.

For radionuclides, concentrations that equal 3s, whereas s is the sample standard deviation, represent a measurement at the minimum detectable concentration, or “reporting level.” Detectable concentrations of radiochemical constituents in water samples from wells in the Snake River Plain aquifer at the INL generally decreased or remained constant during 2002–05. Decreases in concentrations were attributed to decreased rates of radioactive-waste disposal, radioactive decay, changes in waste-disposal methods, and dilution from recharge and underflow. In October 2005, reportable concentrations of tritium in ground water ranged from 0.51±0.12 to 11.5±0.6 picocuries per milliliter and the tritium plume extended south-southwestward in the general direction of ground-water flow. Tritium concentrations in water from several wells southwest of the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC) decreased or remained constant as they had during 1998–2001, with the exception of well USGS 47, which increased a few picocuries per milliliter. Most wells completed in shallow perched water at the Reactor Technology Complex (RTC) were dry during 2002–05. Tritium concentrations in deep perched water exceeded the reporting level in nine wells at the RTC. The tritium concentration in water from one deep perched water well exceeded the reporting level at the INTEC. Concentrations of strontium-90 in water from 14 of 34 wells sampled during October 2005 exceeded the reporting level. Concentrations ranged from 2.2±0.7 to 33.1±1.2 picocuries per liter. However, concentrations from most wells remained relatively constant or decreased since 1989. Strontium-90 has not been detected within the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer beneath the RTC partly because of the exclusive use of waste-disposal ponds and lined evaporation ponds rather than the disposal well for radioactive-wastewater disposal at RTC. At the RTC, strontium-90 concentrations in water from six wells completed in deep perched ground water exceeded the reporting level during 2002-05. At the INTEC, the reporting level was exceeded in water from three wells completed in deep perched ground water. During 2002–05, concentrations of plutonium-238, and plutonium-239, -240 (undivided), and americium-241 were less than the reporting level in water samples from all wells sampled at the INL. During 2002–05, concentrations of cesium-137 in water from all wells sampled by the USGS at the INL were less than the reporting level.

Changes in detectable concentrations of nonradioactive chemical constituents in water from the Snake River Plain aquifer at the INL varied during 2002–05. In April 2005, water from well USGS 65, south of the Reactor Technology Complex (RTC) [formerly known as the Test Reactor Area (TRA)], contained 100 micrograms per liter (µg/L) of chromium, a decrease from the concentration of 139 µg/L detected in October 2001. Other water samples contained from less than 1.7 to 30.3 µg/L of chromium. Chromium was detected in water from 2 wells completed in shallow perched ground water, and in 17 wells completed in deep perched water. During 2002–05, the largest concentration of sodium in water samples from aquifer wells at the INL was 76 milligrams per liter (mg/L) in a sample from well USGS 113, south of INTEC. During April–October 2005, dissolved sodium concentrations in deep perched water at the RTC ranged from 6 to 27 mg/L in all wells except well USGS 68 (370 mg/L). No analyses were made for sodium in shallow perched ground water at the RTC during 2002–05. Dissolved sodium concentrations in water from 16 wells completed in deep perched water at the RTC were determined. At the INTEC, sodium concentrations were determined from one well completed in shallow perched ground water, and from two wells completed in deep perched ground water. In 2005, chloride concentrations in most water samples from the INTEC and the Central Facilities Area (CFA) exceeded ambient concentrations of 10 and 20 mg/L, respectively. Chloride concentrations in water from wells near the RTC were less than 20 mg/L. At the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC), chloride concentrations in water from wells USGS 88, 89, and 120 were 86, 41, and 20 mg/L, respectively, nearly the same as the 1999–2001 reporting period. Concentrations of chloride in all other wells near the RWMC were less than 13 mg/L. During April to October 2005, chloride concentrations in shallow perched ground water from three wells at the RTC ranged from 10 to 32 mg/L and from 3 to 35 mg/L in deep perched ground water. At the INTEC, dissolved chloride concentrations in deep perched ground water in wells closest to the percolation ponds ranged from 118 to 332 mg/L. In 2005, sulfate concentrations in water from aquifer wells USGS 34, 35, and 39, southwest of INTEC, were 42, 46, and 46 mg/L, respectively. Historically, concentrations in these wells have been at or just below 40 mg/L, the estimated background concentration of sulfate in the Snake River Plain aquifer at the INL. The maximum sulfate concentration in water from wells completed in shallow perched ground water at the RTC was 396 mg/L. During April to October 2005, concentrations of dissolved sulfate in water from wells completed in deep perched ground water at the RTC ranged from 66 to 276 mg/L. Concentrations of dissolved sulfate in water from two wells completed in deep perched ground water at the INTEC were 35 mg/L.

In October 2005, concentrations of nitrate in water from wells USGS 41, 43, 45, 47, 52, 57, 67, 77, 112, 114, and 115 near the INTEC, exceeded the regional background of 5 mg/L (as nitrate) and concentrations ranged from 6 mg/L in well USGS 45 to 34 mg/L in well USGS 43. However, since 1981, nitrate concentrations have decreased overall in water from these wells.

During April to October 2005, water samples from five aquifer wells were analyzed for fluoride; detected concentrations ranged from 0.2 to 0.3 mg/L. These concentrations are similar to the background concentrations, which indicate that wastewater disposal has not had an appreciable affect on fluoride concentrations in the Snake River Plain aquifer near the INTEC.

During 2002–05, 12 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were detected in water from aquifer wells at the INL. Concentrations of from 1 to 9 VOCs were detected in water samples from 13 wells. Primary VOCs detected included carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, 1,1-dichloroethane, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, trichloroethylene, and tetrachloroethylene.

During 2002–05, attempts were made each year to sample well USGS 92, completed in perched water at the RWMC; however, lack of water in the well precluded obtaining an adequate sample during most sampling events. Most of the same VOCs except chloroethane that were detected during 1999–2001 were detected during 2002–03; additionally, bromodichloromethane was detected. Concentrations of 16 VOCs were detected during 2002–03. Most VOCs fluctuated through time and show no distinct trend.

Water-quality activities conducted by the staff of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Project Office coincide with the USGS mission of appraising the quantity and quality of the Nation's water resources. The activities are conducted in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Idaho Operations Office. Results of the water-quality investigations are presented in various USGS publications or in refereed scientific journals. The results of the studies are highly regarded, and they are used with confidence by researchers, regulatory and managerial agencies, and interested civic groups. In its broadest sense, quality assurance refers to doing the job right the first time. It includes the functions of planning for products, review and acceptance of the products, and an audit designed to evaluate the system that produces the products. Quality control and quality assurance differ in that quality control ensures that things are done correctly given the “state-of-the-art” technology, and quality assurance ensures that quality control is maintained within specified limits.

Soil structural disturbance influences the downward flow of water that percolates deep enough to become aquifer recharge. Data from identical experiments in an undisturbed silt-loam soil and in an adjacent simulated waste trench composed of the same soil material, but disturbed, included (1) laboratory and field-measured unsaturated hydraulic properties and (2) field-measured transient water content profiles through 24 h of ponded infiltration and 75 d of redistribution. In undisturbed soil, wetting fronts were highly diffuse above 2 m depth, and did not go much deeper than 2 m. Darcian analysis suggests an average recharge rate less than 2 mm/year. In disturbed soil, wetting fronts were sharp and initial infiltration slower; water moved slowly below 2 m without obvious impediment. Richards' equation simulations with realistic conditions predicted sharp wetting fronts, as observed for disturbed soil. Such simulations were adequate for undisturbed soil only if started from a post-initial moisture distribution that included about 3 h of infiltration. These late-started simulations remained good, however, through the 76 d of data. Overall results suggest the net effect of soil disturbance, although it reduces preferential flow, may be to increase recharge by disrupting layer contrasts.

Sediments are believed to comprise as much as 50 percent of the Snake River Plain aquifer thickness in some locations within the Idaho National Laboratory. However, the hydraulic properties of these deep sediments have not been well characterized and they are not represented explicitly in the current conceptual model of subregional scale ground-water flow. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the nature of the sedimentary material within the aquifer and to test the applicability of a site-specific property-transfer model developed for the sedimentary interbeds of the unsaturated zone. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K<sub>sat</sub>) was measured for 10 core samples from sedimentary interbeds within the Snake River Plain aquifer and also estimated using the property-transfer model. The property-transfer model for predicting Ksat was previously developed using a multiple linear-regression technique with bulk physical-property measurements (bulk density [&rho;<sub>bulk</sub>], the median particle diameter, and the uniformity coefficient) as the explanatory variables. The model systematically underestimates K<sub>sat</sub>,typically by about a factor of 10, which likely is due to higher bulk-density values for the aquifer samples compared to the samples from the unsaturated zone upon which the model was developed. Linear relations between the logarithm of K<sub>sat</sub> and &rho;<sub>bulk</sub> also were explored for comparison.

The statistical stationarity of distributions of sedimentary interbed thicknesses within the southwestern part of the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) was evaluated within the stratigraphic framework of Quaternary sediments and basalts at the INL site, eastern Snake River Plain, Idaho. The thicknesses of 122 sedimentary interbeds observed in 11 coreholes were documented from lithologic logs and independently inferred from natural-gamma logs. Lithologic information was grouped into composite time-stratigraphic units based on correlations with existing composite-unit stratigraphy near these holes. The assignment of lithologic units to an existing chronostratigraphy on the basis of nearby composite stratigraphic units may introduce error where correlations with nearby holes are ambiguous or the distance between holes is great, but we consider this the best technique for grouping stratigraphic information in this geologic environment at this time. Nonparametric tests of similarity were used to evaluate temporal and spatial stationarity in the distributions of sediment thickness. The following statistical tests were applied to the data: (1) the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) two-sample test to compare distribution shape, (2) the Mann-Whitney (M-W) test for similarity of two medians, (3) the Kruskal-Wallis (K-W) test for similarity of multiple medians, and (4) Levene's (L) test for the similarity of two variances. Results of these analyses corroborate previous work that concluded the thickness distributions of Quaternary sedimentary interbeds are locally stationary in space and time. The data set used in this study was relatively small, so the results presented should be considered preliminary, pending incorporation of data from more coreholes. Statistical tests also demonstrated that natural-gamma logs consistently fail to detect interbeds less than about 2-3 ft thick, although these interbeds are observable in lithologic logs. This should be taken into consideration when modeling aquifer lithology or hydraulic properties based on lithology.

This report summarizes construction, geophysical, and lithologic data collected from ten U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) boreholes completed between 1999 and 2006 at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL): USGS 126a, 126b, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, and 134. Nine boreholes were continuously cored; USGS 126b had 5 ft of core. Completion depths range from 472 to 1,238 ft. Geophysical data were collected for each borehole, and those data are summarized in this report. Cores were photographed and digitally logged using commercially available software. Digital core logs are in appendixes A through J. Borehole descriptions summarize location, completion date, and amount and type of core recovered. This report was prepared by the USGS in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).

A 1.9-mile reach of the Big Lost River, between the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) diversion dam and the Pioneer diversion structures, was investigated to evaluate the effects of streambed erosion and bedrock constrictions on model predictions of water-surface elevations. Two one-dimensional (1-D) models, a fixed-bed surface-water flow model (HEC-RAS) and a movable-bed surface-water flow and sediment-transport model (HEC-6), were used to evaluate these effects. The results of these models were compared to the results of a two-dimensional (2-D) fixed-bed model [Transient Inundation 2-Dimensional (TRIM2D)] that had previously been used to predict water-surface elevations for peak flows with sufficient stage and stream power to erode floodplain terrain features (Holocene inset terraces referred to as BLR#6 and BLR#8) dated at 300 to 500 years old, and an unmodified Pleistocene surface (referred to as the saddle area) dated at 10,000 years old; and to extend the period of record at the Big Lost River streamflow-gaging station near Arco for flood-frequency analyses. The extended record was used to estimate the magnitude of the 100-year flood and the magnitude of floods with return periods as long as 10,000 years.

In most cases, the fixed-bed TRIM2D model simulated higher water-surface elevations, shallower flow depths, higher flow velocities, and higher stream powers than the fixed-bed HEC-RAS and movable-bed HEC-6 models for the same peak flows. The HEC-RAS model required flow increases of 83 percent [100 to 183 cubic meters per second (m<sup>3</sup>/s)], and 45 percent (100 to 145 m<sup>3</sup>/s) to match TRIM2D simulations of water-surface elevations at two paleoindicator sites that were used to determine peak flows (100 m<sup>3</sup>/s) with an estimated return period of 300 to 500 years; and an increase of 13 percent (150 to 169 m<sup>3</sup>/s) to match TRIM2D water-surface elevations at the saddle area that was used to establish the peak flow (150 m<sup>3</sup>/s) of a paleoflood with a return period of 10,000 years. A field survey of the saddle area, however, indicated that the elevation of the lowest point on the saddle area was 1.2 feet higher than indicated on the 2-ft contour map that was used in the TRIM2D model. Because of this elevation discrepancy, HEC-RAS model simulations indicated that a peak flow of at least 210 m<sup>3</sup>/s would be needed to initiate flow across the 10,000-year old Pleistocene surface.

HEC-6 modeling results indicated that to compensate for the effects of streambed scour, additional flow increases would be needed to match HEC-RAS and TRIM2D water-surface elevations along the upper and middle reaches of the river, and to compensate for sediment deposition, a slight decrease in flows would be needed to match HEC-RAS water-surface elevations along the lower reach of the river.

Differences in simulated water-surface elevations between the TRIM2D and the HEC-RAS and HEC-6 models are attributed primarily to differences in topographic relief and to differences in the channel and floodplain geometries used in these models. Topographic differences were sufficiently large that it was not possible to isolate the effects of these differences on simulated water-surface elevations from those attributable to the effects of supercritical flow, streambed scour, and sediment deposition.

New geochemical and petrological data from corehole USGS-132 and surficial eruptive centers within the Arco-Big Southern Butte Volcanic Rift Zone were assessed to refine basalt stratigraphy in the southwest region of the Idaho National Laboratory. The stratigraphy of USGS-132 is subdivided into fourteen flow groups, several of which correlate to previously identified flow groups.

Butte 5206 and Butte 5159 basalts correlate to the B flow group, indicating eruptions from closely-spaced comagmatic vents. Teakettle Butte and Lavatoo Butte basalts correlate to the E and lower F flow groups, respectively.

The petrogenesis of the B flow group, interpreted using mass balance and thermodynamic models, demonstrate magma evolution by fractional crystallization of relatively primitive magmas at multiple crustal levels and by magma mixing in a shallow reservoir prior to eruption. A single sample of chemically anomalous Shadow Butte basaltic andesite provides additional evidence of magma mixing on the eastern Snake River Plain.

The unsaturated zone at the Idaho National Laboratory is complex, comprising thick basalt flow sequences interbedded with thinner sedimentary layers. Understanding the highly nonlinear relation between water content and hydraulic conductivity within the sedimentary interbeds is one element in predicting water flow and solute transport processes in this geologically complex environment. Measurement of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of sediments is costly and time consuming, therefore use of models that estimate this property from more easily measured bulk-physical properties is desirable.

A capillary bundle model was used to estimate unsaturated hydraulic conductivity for 40 samples from sedimentary interbeds using water-retention parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity derived from (1) laboratory measurements on core samples, and (2) site-specific property transfer regression models developed for the sedimentary interbeds. Four regression models were previously developed using bulk-physical property measurements (bulk density, the median particle diameter, and the uniformity coefficient) as the explanatory variables. The response variables, estimated from linear combinations of the bulk physical properties, included saturated hydraulic conductivity and three parameters that define the water-retention curve.

The degree to which the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curves estimated from property-transfer-modeled water-retention parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity approximated the laboratory-measured data was evaluated using a goodness-of-fit indicator, the root-mean-square error. Because numerical models of variably saturated flow and transport require parameterized hydraulic properties as input, simulations were run to evaluate the effect of the various parameters on model results. Results show that the property transfer models based on easily measured bulk properties perform nearly as well as using curve fits to laboratory-measured water retention for the estimation of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity.

## WelhanOthers2007

The spatial distribution of sediment in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer was evaluated and modeled to improve the parameterization of hydraulic conductivity (K) for a subregional-scale ground-water flow model being developed by the U.S. Geological Survey. The aquifer is hosted within a layered series of permeable basalts within which intercalated beds of fine-grained sediment constitute local confining units. These sediments have K values as much as six orders of magnitude lower than the most permeable basalt, and previous flow-model calibrations have shown that hydraulic conductivity is sensitive to the proportion of intercalated sediment.

Stratigraphic data in the form of sediment thicknesses from 333 boreholes in and around the Idaho National Laboratory were evaluated as grouped subsets of lithologic units (composite units) corresponding to their relative time-stratigraphic position. The results indicate that median sediment abundances of the stratigraphic units below the water table are statistically invariant (stationary) in a spatial sense and provide evidence of stationarity across geologic time, as well. Based on these results, the borehole data were kriged as two-dimensional spatial data sets representing the sediment content of the layers that discretize the ground-water flow model in the uppermost 300 feet of the aquifer.

Multiple indicator kriging (mIK) was used to model the geographic distribution of median sediment abundance within each layer by defining the local cumulative frequency distribution (CFD) of sediment via indicator variograms defined at multiple thresholds. The mIK approach is superior to ordinary kriging because it provides a statistically best estimate of sediment abundance (the local median) drawn from the distribution of local borehole data, independent of any assumption of normality. A methodology is proposed for delineating and constraining the assignment of hydraulic conductivity zones for parameter estimation, based on the locally estimated CFDs and relative kriging uncertainty. A kriging-based methodology improves the spatial resolution of hydraulic property zones that can be considered during parameter estimation and should improve calibration performance and sensitivity by more accurately reflecting the nuances of sediment distribution within the aquifer.

Ground-water flow in the west-central part of the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer is described in a conceptual model that will be used in numerical simulations to evaluate contaminant transport at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) and vicinity. The model encompasses an area of 1,940 square miles (mi<sup>2</sup>) and includes most of the 890 mi<sup>2</sup> of the INL. A 50-year history of waste disposal associated with research activities at the INL has resulted in measurable concentrations of waste contaminants in the aquifer. A thorough understanding of the fate and movement of these contaminants in the subsurface is needed by the U.S. Department of Energy to minimize the effect that contaminated ground water may have on the region and to plan effectively for remediation.

Three hydrogeologic units were used to represent the complex stratigraphy of the aquifer in the model area. Collectively, these hydrogeologic units include at least 65 basalt-flow groups, 5 andesite-flow groups, and 61 sedimentary interbeds. Three rhyolite domes in the model area extend deep enough to penetrate the aquifer. The rhyolite domes are represented in the conceptual model as low permeability, vertical plug like masses, and are not included as part of the three primary hydrogeologic units. Broad differences in lithology and large variations in hydraulic properties allowed the heterogeneous, anisotropic basalt-flow groups, andesite-flow groups, and sedimentary interbeds to be grouped into three hydrogeologic units that are conceptually homogeneous and anisotropic. Younger rocks, primarily thin, densely fractured basalt, compose hydrogeologic unit 1; younger rocks, primarily of massive, less densely fractured basalt, compose hydrogeologic unit 2; and intermediate-age rocks, primarily of slightly-to-moderately altered, fractured basalt, compose hydrogeologic unit 3. Differences in hydraulic properties among adjacent hydrogeologic units result in much of the large-scale heterogeneity and anisotropy of the aquifer in the model area, and differences in horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity in individual hydrogeologic units result in much of the small-scale heterogeneity and anisotropy of the aquifer in the model area.

The inferred three-dimensional geometry of the aquifer in the model area is very irregular. Its thickness generally increases from north to south and from west to east and is greatest south of the INL. The interpreted distribution of older rocks that underlie the aquifer indicates large changes in saturated thickness across the model area.

The boundaries of the model include physical and artificial boundaries, and ground-water flows across the boundaries may be temporally constant or variable and spatially uniform or nonuniform. Physical boundaries include the water-table boundary, base of the aquifer, and northwest mountain-front boundary. Artificial boundaries include the northeast boundary, southeast-flowline boundary, and southwest boundary. Water flows into the model area as (1) underflow (1,225 cubic feet per second (ft<sup>3</sup>/s)) from the regional aquifer (northeast boundary—constant and nonuniform), (2) underflow (695 ft<sup>3</sup>/s) from the tributary valleys and mountain fronts (northwest boundary—constant and nonuniform), (3) precipitation recharge (70 ft<sup>3</sup>/s) (constant and uniform), streamflow-infiltration recharge (95 ft<sup>3</sup>/s) (variable and nonuniform), wastewater return flows (6 ft<sup>3</sup>/s) (variable and nonuniform), and irrigation-infiltration recharge (24 ft<sup>3</sup>/s) (variable and nonuniform) across the water table (water-table boundary—variable and nonuniform), and (4) upward flow across the base of the aquifer (44 ft<sup>3</sup>/s) (uniform and constant). The southeast-flowline boundary is represented as a no-flow boundary. Water flows out of the model area as underflow (2,037 ft<sup>3</sup>/s) to the regional aquifer (southwest boundary—variable and nonuniform) and as ground-water withdrawals (45 ft<sup>3</sup>/s) (water table boundary—variable and nonuniform).

Ground-water flow increases progressively in a direction downgradient of the northeast boundary. This increased flow is the result of tributary-valley and mountain-front underflows along the northwest boundary and precipitation recharge and streamflow-infiltration recharge across the water-table boundary. Ground water flows in all three hydrogeologic units beneath the INL. South of the INL, the younger rocks, hydrogeologic units 1 and 2, are either not present or are above the water table and all flow occurs through the intermediate-age rocks, hydrogeologic unit 3.

The direction of regional ground-water flow is from northeast to southwest. Flow directions beneath the INL vary locally from southeast to southwest and fluctuate in response to episodic recharge from streamflow infiltration. Water-table gradients immediately upgradient of the northeast boundary are 27 to 60 feet per mile (ft/mi); and southwest of the INL gradients are 4 to 30 ft/mi. Beneath the INL gradients are much flatter, 1 to 8 ft/mi, and precise definition of flow direction is difficult to determine.

Long-term monitoring of contaminant movement in the aquifer at the INL indicates that ground-water velocities in the thin, fractured basalts of hydrogeologic unit 1, the uppermost hydrogeologic unit of the aquifer, range from 4 to 20 feet per day (ft/d) south of the Test Reactor Area and the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center. These velocities probably indicate preferential flow along the many interflow zones of the thin, fractured basalt flows composing the uppermost hydrogeologic unit. Hydraulic conductivities (500 to 5,000 ft/d) estimated from velocity measurements were consistent with those derived from aquifer tests conducted in this hydrogeologic unit. Almost two-thirds of the hydraulic conductivities derived from aquifer-test measurements in hydrogeologic unit 1 were larger than 100 ft/d and about one‑third were larger than 1,000 ft/d.

Most contaminant movement beneath the INL probably takes place in the thin, densely fractured, and highly conductive basalts and interbedded sediments of hydrogeologic unit 1, which compose most of the upper 200 ft of the aquifer beneath most of the INL. This hypothesis is based on interpretation of a generalized northeast-to-southwest cross section of ground-water flow across the model area that depicts the effects of the hydrogeologic framework on flow in each of the hydrogeologic units used to represent the aquifer. This interpretation indicates that head decreases and then increases with depth with thickening and thinning of the aquifer in a direction downgradient of the northeast boundary. Beneath the INL, the smaller conductivity of the massive, less densely fractured basalts and interbedded sediments of hydrogeologic unit 2 restricts the downward movement of contaminants from hydrogeologic unit 1. The largest changes in water-table gradients are upgradient of where the massive basalts of hydrogeologic unit 2 are inferred to intersect the water table south of the INL. Water probably flows downward through hydrogeologic unit 2 into hydrogeologic unit 3 at this location, implying deeper circulation of contaminants that migrate offsite.

Features of the conceptual model that most affect interpretations of contaminant transport are (1) implicit representation of infiltration recharge through the unsaturated zone, (2) preferential flow along highly conductive interflow zones, primarily in the thin, densely fractured basalts of hydrogeologic unit 1, implying large horizontal to vertical anisotropy, (3) restricted downward movement of flow and contaminants in hydrogeologic unit 1 into the less conductive basalts of hydrogeologic unit 2 beneath the INL, (4) the inferred downward movement and deeper circulation of water upgradient of where the massive, less densely fractured basalt of hydrogeologic unit 2 intersects the water table southwest of the INL, and (5) enhanced dispersion of contaminants resulting from the spatial and temporal variability of streamflow-infiltration recharge that is in close proximity to contaminated ground water.

Radiochemical and chemical wastewater discharged since 1952 to infiltration ponds, evaporation ponds, and disposal wells at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has affected water quality in the Snake River Plain aquifer underlying the INL. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, maintains ground-water monitoring networks at the INL to determine hydrologic trends, and to delineate the movement of radiochemical and chemical wastes in the aquifer. This report presents an analysis of water-level and water-quality data collected from wells in the USGS ground-water monitoring networks during 1999–2001.

Water in the Snake River Plain aquifer moves principally through fractures and interflow zones in basalt, generally flows southwestward, and eventually discharges at springs along the Snake River. The aquifer is recharged principally from infiltration of irrigation water, infiltration of streamflow, ground-water inflow from adjoining mountain drainage basins, and infiltration of precipitation. Water levels in wells rose in the northern and west-central parts of the INL by 1 to 3 feet, and declined in the southwestern parts of the INL by up to 4 feet during 1999–2001.

Detectable concentrations of radiochemical constituents in water samples from wells in the Snake River Plain aquifer at the INL generally decreased or remained constant during 1999–2001. Decreases in concentrations were attributed to decreased rates of radioactive-waste disposal, radioactive decay, changes in waste-disposal methods, and dilution from recharge. Tritium concentrations in water samples decreased as much as 8.3 picocuries per milliliter (pCi/mL) during 1999–2001, ranging from 0.43±0.14 to 13.6±0.6 pCi/mL in October 2001. Tritium concentrations in five wells near the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC) increased a few picocuries per milliliter from October 2000 to October 2001. Strontium-90 concentrations decreased or remained constant during 1999–2001, ranging from 2.1±0.6 to 42.4±1.4 pCi/L in October 2001. During 1999–2001, concentrations of cesium-137, plutonium-238, and plutonium-239, -240 (undivided) were less than the reporting level in water samples from all wells sampled at the INL. The concentration of americium-241 in one sample was 0.003±0.001 pCi/L, the reporting level for that constituent. Cobalt-60 was not detected in any samples collected during 1999–2001.

Changes in detectable concentrations of nonradioactive chemical constituents in water from the Snake River Plain aquifer at the INL varied during 1999–2001. In October 2001, water from one well south of the Reactor Technology Complex (RTC) [known as the Test Reactor Area (TRA) until 2005] contained 139 micrograms per liter (µg/L) of chromium, a decrease from the concentration of 168 µg/L detected in October 1998. Other water samples contained from less than 16.7 to 21.3 µg/L of chromium. In October 2001, concentrations of sodium in water samples from most of the wells in the southern part of the INL were larger than the background concentration of 10 mg/L, but were similar to or slightly less than October 1998 concentrations. The largest sodium concentration was 75 milligrams per liter (mg/L) in water from well USGS 113.

In 2001, chloride concentrations in most water samples from the INTEC and the Central Facilities Area (CFA) exceeded ambient concentrations of 10 and 20 mg/L, respectively. Chloride concentrations in water from wells near the RTC were less than 20 mg/L. At the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC), chloride concentrations in water from wells USGS 88, 89, and 120 were 81, 40, and 23 mg/L, respectively. Concentrations of chloride in all other wells near the RWMC were less than 19 mg/L. During 2001, concentrations of sulfate in water from two wells near the RTC, two wells near the RWMC, and one well near the CFA exceeded 40 mg/L, the estimated background concentration of sulfate in the Snake River Plain aquifer at the INL.

In 2001, concentrations of nitrate in water from wells USGS 40, 43, 77, and CFA 1 were 16, 21, 16, and 14 mg/L as nitrate, respectively. These generally were smaller concentrations than those in 1998, with the exception of the concentration in water from well USGS 40, which had slightly increased. However, since 1981, there has been an overall decrease in nitrate concentration in water from these wells.

During 1999–2001, water samples from 12 wells were analyzed for fluoride; detected concentrations ranged from 0.2 to 0.3 mg/L. These concentrations are similar to background concentrations, indicating that wastewater disposal has not had an appreciable affect on fluoride concentrations in the Snake River Plain aquifer near the INTEC.

During 1999–2001, 10 purgeable organic compounds (POCs) were detected in water from wells at the INL. Water samples from 17 wells contained from 1 to 5 of these POCs in October 2001. Concentrations of 1,1,1-trichloroethane were greater than the reporting level in samples from four wells near the INTEC. Concentrations of several POCs exceeded their minimum reporting levels in wells at or near the RWMC.

Radiochemical and chemical wastes generated at facilities at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) were discharged since 1952 to infiltration ponds at the Reactor Technology Complex (RTC) (known as the Test Reactor Area [TRA] until 2005), and the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC) and buried at the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC). Disposal of wastewater to infiltration ponds and infiltration of surface water at waste burial sites resulted in formation of perched ground water in basalts and in sedimentary interbeds above the Snake River Plain aquifer. Perched ground water is an integral part of the pathway for waste-constituent migration to the aquifer.

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, maintains ground-water monitoring networks at the INL to determine hydrologic trends, and to monitor the movement of radiochemical and chemical constituents in wastewater discharged from facilities to both perched ground water and the aquifer. This report presents an analysis of water-quality and water-level data collected from wells completed in perched ground water at the INL during 1999–2001, and summarizes historical disposal data and water-level-and water-quality trends.

At the RTC, tritium, strontium-90, cesium-137, dissolved chromium, chloride, sodium, and sulfate were monitored in shallow and deep perched ground water. In shallow perched ground water, no tritium was detected above the reporting level. In deep perched ground water, tritium concentrations generally decreased or varied randomly during 1999–2001. During October 2001, tritium concentrations ranged from less than the reporting level to 39.4±1.4 picocuries per milliliter (pCi/mL). Reportable concentrations of tritium during July‑October 2001 were smaller than the reported concentrations measured during July–December 1998. Tritium concentrations in water from wells at the RTC were likely affected by: well’s distance from the radioactive‑waste infiltration ponds (commonly referred to as the warm‑waste ponds); water depth below the ponds; the amount of tritium discharged to radioactive-waste infiltration ponds in the past; discontinued use of radioactive-waste infiltration ponds; radioactive decay; and dilution from disposal of nonradioactive water.

During 1999–2001, the strontium-90 concentrations in two wells completed in shallow perched water near the RTC exceeded the reporting level. Strontium-90 concentrations in water from wells completed in deep perched ground water at the RTC varied randomly with time. During October 2001, concentrations in water from five wells exceeded the reporting level and ranged from 2.8±0.7 picocuries per liter (pCi/L) in well USGS 63 to 83.8±2.1 pCi/L in well USGS 54. No reportable concentrations of cesium-137, chromium-51, or cobalt-60 were present in water samples from any of the shallow or deep wells at the RTC during 1999–2001.

Dissolved chromium was not detected in shallow perched ground water at the RTC during 1999–2001. Concentrations of dissolved chromium during July–October 2001 in deep perched ground water near the RTC ranged from 10 micrograms per liter (µg/L) in well USGS 61 to 82 µg/L in well USGS 55. The largest concentrations were in water from wells north and west of the radioactive-waste infiltration ponds. During July–October 2001, dissolved sodium concentrations ranged from 7 milligrams per liter (mg/L) in well USGS 78 to 20 mg/L in all wells except well USGS 68 (413 mg/L). Dissolved chloride concentrations in shallow perched ground water ranged from 10 mg/L in wells CWP 1, 3, and 4 to 53 mg/L in well TRA A 13 during 1999–2001. Dissolved chloride concentrations in deep perched ground water ranged from 5 mg/L in well USGS 78 to 91 mg/L in well USGS 73. The maximum dissolved sulfate concentration in shallow perched ground water was 419 mg/L in well CWP 1 during July 2000. Concentrations of dissolved sulfate in water from wells USGS 54, 60, 63, 69, and PW 8, completed in deep perched ground water near the cold-waste ponds, ranged from 115 to 285 mg/L in July–October 2001. The maximum concentration of dissolved sulfate in water during July–October 2001 was 1,409 mg/L in well USGS 68 west of the chemical-waste pond.

At the INTEC, tritium, strontium-90, cesium-137, dissolved sodium, chloride, sulfate, and nitrite plus nitrate (as nitrogen) were monitored in shallow and deep perched ground water. No reportable concentrations of tritium were measured in shallow perched ground water during 1999–2001. The tritium concentration in water from wells completed in deep perched ground water beneath the infiltration ponds ranged from less than the reporting level in wells PW 1 and PW 5 to 9.7±0.5 pCi/mL in well PW 6 during 1999–2001. The strontium-90 concentration in water from well SWP 8, completed in shallow perched ground water, was 2.1±0.7 pCi/L in July 2001. In October 2001, strontium-90 concentrations in deep perched ground water in wells closest to the ponds were less than the reporting level, not sampled because of access problems, or the wells were dry.

Dissolved sodium, chloride, and sulfate concentrations in shallow and deep perched ground water at the INTEC infiltration ponds during 1999–2001 were similar to or less than the average annual effluent monitoring data.

At the RWMC, tritium, strontium-90, cesium-137, plutonium-238, plutonium-239, -240 (undivided), americium-241, dissolved chloride, and a suite of volatile organic compounds were monitored in deep perched ground water at well USGS 92. Radiochemical constituents in all water samples from well USGS 92 were less than the reporting level with the exception of the April 2000 and October 2001 samples analyzed for tritium. The tritium concentration was at the reporting level at 0.3±.0.1 pCi/mL in April 2000 and slightly above the reporting level at 0.45±0.14 pCi/mL in October 2001. Samples contained concentrations greater than the minimum reporting levels of 15 volatile organic compounds.

This report presents qualitative and quantitative comparisons of water-quality data from the Idaho National Laboratory, Idaho, to determine if the change from purging three wellbore volumes to one wellbore volume has a discernible effect on the comparability of the data. Historical water-quality data for 30 wells were visually compared to water-quality data collected after purging only 1 wellbore volume from the same wells. Of the 322 qualitatively examined constituent plots, 97.5 percent met 1 or more of the criteria established for determining data comparability. A simple statistical equation to determine if water-quality data collected from 28 wells at the INL with long purge times (after pumping 1 and 3 wellbore volumes of water) were statistically the same at the 95-percent confidence level indicated that 97.9 percent of 379 constituent pairs were equivalent.

Comparability of water-quality data determined from both the qualitative (97.5 percent comparable) and quantitative (97.9 percent comparable) evaluations after purging 1 and 3 wellbore volumes of water indicates that the change from purging 3 to 1 wellbore volumes had no discernible effect on comparability of water-quality data at the INL. However, the qualitative evaluation was limited because only October-November 2003 data were available for comparison to historical data. This report was prepared by the U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy.

Linear-regression analysis was applied to stable hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) isotope data in 72 snow-core and precipitation samples collected during 1999-2001 to determine the Local Meteoric Water Line (LMWL) for southeastern Idaho, western Wyoming, and south-central Montana.

On the basis of (1) residuals from the regression model, (2) comparison of study-area deuterium-excess (d-excess) values with the global range of d-excess values, and (3) outlier analysis by means of Chauvenet’s Criterion, values of four samples were excluded from final regression analysis of the dataset. Regression results for the 68 remaining samples yielded a LMWL defined by the equation δ2H = 7.95 δ18O + 8.09 (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.98).

This equation will be useful as a reference point for future studies in this area that use stable isotopes of H and O to determine sources of ground-water recharge, to determine water-mineral exchange, to evaluate surface-water and ground-water interaction, and to analyze many other geochemical and hydrologic problems.

Linear regression analysis is routinely applied to stable hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) isotope data from precipitation-water samples to determine a local meteoric water line. Several local meteoric water lines have been determined for southeastern Idaho and the adjacent Yellowstone National Park from data sets that represent winter precipitation conditions, summer precipitation conditions, evaporated surface water, and ground water. For example, two local meteoric water lines calculated for this report from full ranges of seasonal precipitation data for rain and snow samples are represented by the equations, δ<sup>2</sup>H = 7.48 δ<sup>18</sup>O - 0.04 and δ<sup>2</sup>H = 7.94 δ<sup>18</sup>O + 3.15. Another equation developed in 1988, δ<sup>2</sup>H = 6.42 δ<sup>18</sup>O - 21, was constructed from surface-water data under the assumption that the surface water was entirely derived from local precipitation. In this paper, we compare a range of reported local meteoric water lines for southeastern Idaho with the Global Meteoric Water Line (δ<sup>2</sup>H = 8 δ<sup>18</sup>O + 10) and discuss some of the hydrologic implications. We then construct a local meteoric water line for southeastern Idaho by combining precipitation data from two sources; the resultant equation for this local meteoric water line is δ<sup>2</sup>H = 7.61 δ<sup>18</sup>O + 0.84. Finally, we analyze the precipitation data for seasonal signals; winter was represented by samples collected between October and April, and summer was represented by samples collected from May through September. This analysis suggests that the average δ<sup>18</sup>O of ground water from the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer is dominated by recharge derived from winter precipitation.

The equations and the associated hydrologic implications presented here will be useful as reference points for future studies on the eastern Snake River Plain in southeastern Idaho and the adjacent recharge areas in Wyoming and Montana. The results of this analysis might be used to determine sources of ground-water recharge, to study water-rock chemical reactions, to evaluate surface-water and ground-water interaction and residence times, and to study other geochemical and hydrologic topics.

The U.S. Geological Survey and the Idaho Department of Water Resources, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, sampled water from 14 sites as part of an ongoing study to monitor the water quality of the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer between the southern boundary of the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) and the Burley-Twin Falls-Hager-man area. The State of Idaho, Department of Environmental Quality, Division of INL Oversight and Radiation Control cosampled with the U.S. Geological Survey and the Idaho Department of Water Resources and their analytical results are included in this report. The samples were collected from four domestic wells, two dairy wells, two springs, four irrigation wells, one observation well, and one stock well and analyzed for selected radiochemical and chemical constituents. Two quality-assurance samples, sequential replicates, also were collected and analyzed. None of the concentrations of radiochemical or organic-chemical constituents exceeded the maximum contaminant levels for drinking water established by the U.S. Environ-mental Protection Agency. However, the concentration of one inorganic-chemical constituent, nitrate (as nitrogen), in water from site MV-43 was 20 milligrams per liter which exceeded the maximum contaminant level for that constituent. Of the radiochemical and chemical concentrations analyzed for in the replicate-sample pairs, 267 of the 270 pairs (with 95 percent confidence) were statistically equivalent.

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) requested that the U.S. Geological Survey conduct an independent technical review of the Interim Risk Assessment (IRA) and Contaminant Screening for the Waste Area Group 7 (WAG-7) Remedial Investigation, the draft Addendum to the Work Plan for Operable Unit 7-13/14 WAG-7 comprehensive Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS), and supporting documents that were prepared by Lockheed Martin Idaho Technologies, Inc.

The purpose of the technical review was to assess the data and geotechnical approaches that were used to estimate future risks associated with the release of the actinides americium, uranium, neptunium, and plutonium to the Snake River Plain aquifer from wastes buried in pits and trenches at the Subsurface Disposal Area (SDA). The SDA is located at the Radioactive Waste Management Complex in southeastern Idaho within the boundaries of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. Radionuclides have been buried in pits and trenches at the SDA since 1957 and 1952, respectively. Burial of transuranic wastes was discontinued in 1982.

The five specific tasks associated with this review were defined in a “Proposed Scope of Work” prepared by the DOE, and a follow-up workshop held in June 1998. The specific tasks were (1) to review the radionuclide sampling data to determine how reliable and significant are the reported radionuclide detections and how reliable is the ongoing sampling program, (2) to assess the physical and chemical processes that logically can be invoked to explain true detections, (3) to determine if distribution coefficients that were used in the IRA are reliable and if they have been applied properly, (4) to determine if transport model predictions are technically sound, and (5) to identify issues needing resolution to determine technical adequacy of the risk assessment analysis, and what additional work is required to resolve those issues.

Because characterizing the unsaturated hydraulic properties of sediments over large areas or depths is costly and time consuming, development of models that predict these properties from more easily measured bulk-physical properties is desirable. At the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, the unsaturated zone is composed of thick basalt flow sequences interbedded with thinner sedimentary layers. Determining the unsaturated hydraulic properties of sedimentary layers is one step in understanding water flow and solute transport processes through this complex unsaturated system. Multiple linear regression was used to construct simple property-transfer models for estimating the water-retention curve and saturated hydraulic conductivity of deep sediments at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. The regression models were developed from 109 core sample subsets with laboratory measurements of hydraulic and bulk-physical properties. The core samples were collected at depths of 9 to 175 meters at two facilities within the southwestern portion of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory—the Radioactive Waste Management Complex, and the Vadose Zone Research Park southwest of the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center. Four regression models were developed using bulk-physical property measurements (bulk density, particle density, and particle size) as the potential explanatory variables. Three representations of the particle-size distribution were compared: (1) textural-class percentages (gravel, sand, silt, and clay), (2) geometric statistics (mean and standard deviation), and (3) graphical statistics (median and uniformity coefficient). The four response variables, estimated from linear combinations of the bulk-physical properties, included saturated hydraulic conductivity and three parameters that define the water-retention curve.

For each core sample, values of each water-retention parameter were estimated from the appropriate regression equation and used to calculate an estimated water-retention curve. The degree to which the estimated curve approximated the measured curve was quantified using a goodness-of-fit indicator, the root-mean-square error. Comparison of the root-mean-square-error distributions for each alternative particle-size model showed that the estimated water-retention curves were insensitive to the way the particle-size distribution was represented. Bulk density, the median particle diameter, and the uniformity coefficient were chosen as input parameters for the final models. The property-transfer models developed in this study allow easy determination of hydraulic properties without need for their direct measurement. Additionally, the models provide the basis for development of theoretical models that rely on physical relationships between the pore-size distribution and the bulk-physical properties of the media. With this adaptation, the property-transfer models should have greater application throughout the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory and other geographic locations.

Snow samples were collected in southeastern Idaho over two winters to assess trace element and common ion concentrations in air pollutant fallout across the region. The objectives were to: (1) develop snow sampling and analysis techniques that produce accurate and ultra-low measurements of a broad suite of fallout elements, (2) identify the spatial and temporal trends of the fallout elements across the region, (3) determine if there are unique combinations of fallout elements that are characteristic to the major source areas in the region (source area profiles), and (4) use pattern recognition and multivariate statistical techniques (principal component analysis and classical least squares regression) to investigate source area apportionment of fallout concentrations measured at downwind locations where plumes from different source areas might mix. In the winter of 2000–2001, 250 snow samples were collected across the region over a 4-month period and analyzed in triplicate using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP MS) and ion chromatography (IC). Thirty nine trace elements and nine common ions were positively identified in most samples. The data were analyzed using pattern recognition tools in the software, Pirouette® (Infometrix). These results showed a large crustal component (Al, Zn, Mn, Ba, and rare earth elements), an overwhelming contribution from phosphate processing facilities located outside Pocatello in the southern portion of the Eastern Snake River Plain, some changes in concentrations over time, and no obvious source area profiles (unique chemical signatures) other than at Pocatello. Concentrations near a major U.S. Department of Energy industrial complex on the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) were lower than those observed at major downwind communities. In the winter of 2001–2002, a new sampling design was tested and 135 additional samples collected to estimate pure emission profiles from the major source areas in the region. Classical least squares regression (CLS) was then used to source apportion these profiles at downwind mixing sites where plumes from the different source areas mixed. CLS performed reasonably well, predicting 36–58% of the total fallout concentrations measured at the mixing sites.

The eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP) volcanic province has been dominated by basaltic volcanism for at least 3.2 Ma. Basalt core from three boreholes, USGS 127, 128, and 129. drilled at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) are used to document the subsurface chemostratigraphy of ESRP basalts and to understand the origin of their chemical variability. The stratigraphy of these coreholes was defined by detailed geochemical analysis of individual flows combined with paleomagnetic inclination data, Lava flows with similar chemistry and paleomagnetic inclination were identified and correlated between the three cores to refine the subsurface stratigraphy in this region.

One lava flow group from these cores, known as the “high K” now group, is distinguished from typical olivine tholeiites on the ESRP by unusually high concentrations of incompatible elements and unusually low Sr isotopic ratios. The major element, trace element. and isotopic characteristics of this flow group were studied in detail in order to explain its petrogenetic history, Mass-balance modeling indicates that fractionation of plagioclase, olivine, magnetite, and apatite from a plausible olivine tholeiite parent magma could produce the high K now group lavas. However, thermodynamic modeling of fractionation of the parent magma under higher redox conditions could not reproduce the required mineral assemblage. Another mechanism for the removal of magnetite and apatite in addition to olivine and plagioclase from the high K flow group parent magma is required. The high K flow group may be part of a chemically continuous series of lavas that includes the underlying lava flow group, designated here as flow group 4.

This study examines the origin of basalt alteration that correlates with the sharp, but irregular boundary between active and deeper, much less conductive portions of the eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP) aquifer system. I specifically investigate three hypotheses for the origin of the boundary: (1) that basalt alteration took place in-situ, post-emplacement, while the basalt was within the ESRP aquifer system under ambient aquifer temperature and aqueous geochemical conditions, (2) that basalt alteration took place in-situ, post-emplacement, while the basalt was within the ESRP aquifer system under elevated temperature and different aqueous geochemical conditions, and (3) that basalt altered syn-emplacement, during the peperitization process.

A majority of altered basaltic units in borehole Middle 1823 also exhibit prominent syn-emplacement, peperitic intermingling between the molten basalt and wet sediment. Peperitization of basalts is distinguished from subaerially or palagonitized basalt by zones of intermingled basalt and sediment displaying amoeboid-shaped basalt clasts with fluidal, oxidized margins intermingling with sediment at glass-rich contact regions between basalt and sediment, as well as clastic dikes of sediment and sediment amygdules within the basalt flows. Thus some alteration occurred during the peperitization of the basalt, which was later overprinted by in-situ alteration.

Fluid inclusion microthermometry indicates that in-situ alteration associated calcite precipitated at temperatures 7-20°C higher than the present day temperatures. This is substantially higher than expected ambient variability within the aquifer and supports hypothesis # 2. Transient inputs of warm, reactive hydrothermal groundwater from depth (McLing et al., 1997; McLing et al., 2002; Morse and McCurry, 2002; Morse, 2002) with local variations in extent, magnitude, and flux, best explain the 3 dimensional variations in the morphology of the contact between the active portion and the base of the ESRP aquifer.

Questions of major importance for subsurface contaminant transport at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) include (i) travel times to the aquifer, both average or typical values and the range of values to be expected, and (ii) modes of contaminant transport, especially sorption processes. The hydraulic and geochemical framework within which these questions are addressed is dominated by extreme heterogeneity in a vadose zone and aquifer consisting of interbedded basalts and sediments. Hydraulically, major issues include diverse possible types of flow pathways, extreme anisotropy, preferential flow, combined vertical and horizontal flow, and temporary saturation or perching. Geochemically, major issues include contaminant mobility as influenced by redox conditions, the concentration of organic and inorganic complexing solutes and other local variables, the interaction with infiltrating waters and with the contaminant source environment, and the aqueous speciation of contaminants such as actinides. Another major issue is the possibility of colloid transport, which inverts some of the traditional concepts of mobility, as sorbed contaminants on mobile colloids may be transported with ease compared with contaminants that are not sorbed. With respect to the goal of minimizing aquifer concentrations of contaminants, some characteristics of the vadose zone are essentially completely favorable. Examples include the great thickness (200 m) of the vadose zone, and the presence of substantial quantities of fine sediments that can retard contaminant transport both hydraulically and chemically. Most characteristics, however, have both favorable and unfavorable aspects. For example, preferential flow, as promoted by several notable features of the vadose zone at the INEEL, can provide fast, minimally sorbing pathways for contaminants to reach the aquifer easily, but it also leads to a wide dispersal of contaminants in a large volume of subsurface material, thus increasing the opportunity for dilution and sorption.

The U.S. Geological Survey, Idaho Department of Water Resources, and the State of Idaho INEEL Oversight Program, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, sampled water from 17 sites as part of the sixth round of a long-term project to monitor water quality of the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer from the southern boundary of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory to the Hagerman area. The samples were collected from eight irrigation wells, three domestic wells, one stock well, one dairy well, one commercial well, one observation well, and two springs and analyzed for selected radiochemical and chemical constituents. One quality-assurance sample, a sequential replicate, also was collected and analyzed.

Many of the radionuclide and inorganic-constituent concentrations were greater than the reporting levels and most of the organic-constituent concentrations were less than the reporting levels. However, none of the reported radiochemical- or chemical-constituent concentrations exceeded the maximum contaminant levels for drinking water established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Statistical evaluation of the replicate sample pair indicated that, with 95 percent confidence, 132 of the 135 constituent concentrations of the replicate pair were equivalent

The objective of this report is to briefly describe the VETEM system, data collection procedures, and display the preliminary raw images of the data. Within this report images are presented from the deployment of the USGS prototype Very Early Time Electromagnetic (VETEM) system at Pits 4 and 10 within the Subsurface Disposal Area (SDA) of the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC) at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). These images are of raw data that have not been leveled nor has the system response been removed. The images are positioned with a real time kinematic global positioning system (RTK-GPS). The data have been processed for position accuracy and data validity. Images are produced from selected time slices of the VETEM data. Results indicate the VETEM system is responding throughout the recorded time series and can detect many subsurface conductive objects within Pit 4 and Pit 10.

Water-quality activities at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) Project Office are part of the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) mission of appraising the quantity and quality of the Nation's water resources. The activities are conducted in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Idaho Operations Office and the U.S. Environment Protection Agency, Region 10. Results of the water-quality investigations are presented in various USGS publications or in refereed scientific journals. The results of the studies are highly regarded and are used with confidence by researchers, regulatory and managerial agencies, and interested civic groups. In its broadest sense, quality assurance refers to doing the job right, the first time. It includes the functions of planning for products, review and acceptance of the products, and an audit designed to evaluate the system that produces the product. Quality assurance and quality control differ in that quality control ensures that things are done correctly given the “state-of-the-art” technology, and quality assurance ensures that quality control is maintained within specified limits.

Information is needed by the U.S. Department of Energy at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory to determine the extent and severity of potential flooding at facilities along the Big Lost River. Two computer programs—the Culvert Analysis Program (CAP) and the HECRAS model—were used to define stage-discharge relations for 31 culverts and 2 bridge sites in a 10-mile reach of the river. These relations can be used to improve surface-water-flow models to evaluate potential flooding. Relations between headwater, tailwater, and discharge through each structure were unique. Discharge through the culverts as computed by the CAP ranged from about 0 cubic feet per second to as much discharge as could be conveyed, and tailwater elevations ranged from about 0 to 30 feet above the outlet elevation. Discharge through the bridges, as computed by the HEC-RAS model, ranged from nearly 0 to 7,000 cubic feet per second, and tailwater elevations ranged from nearly 0 to 30 feet above the streambed on the downstream cross section of each bridge. Stage-discharge relations provided in lookup tables in this report can be incorporated into numerical surface-water-flow models to simulate the effects of hydraulic structures on flood flows. One limitation of the CAP and HEC-RAS models is that changes in flow conditions, such as obstruction by sediment and debris, are not simulated. If flow through a hydraulic structure is obstructed by sediment or debris, then model-simulated discharges through the structure might be greater than would be experienced under actual conditions.

Background concentrations of iodine-129 (<sup>129</sup>I, half-life = 15.7 million years) resulting from natural production in the earth's atmosphere, in situ production in the earth by spontaneous fission of uranium-238 (<sup>238</sup>U), and fallout from nuclear weapons tests conducted in the 1950s and 1960s were reevaluated on the basis of 52 analyses of ground- and surface-water samples collected from the eastern Snake River Plain in southeastern Idaho. The background concentration estimated using the results of a subset of 30 ground-water samples analyzed in this reevaluation is 5.4 attocuries per liter (aCi/L; 1 aCi = 10<sup>-18</sup> curies) and the 95-percent nonparametric confidence interval is 5.2 to 10.0 aCi/L. In a previous study, a background <sup>129</sup>I concentration was estimated on the basis of analyses of water samples from 16 sites on or tributary to the eastern Snake River Plain. At the 99-percent confidence level, background concentrations of <sup>129</sup>I in that study were less than or equal to 8.2 aCi/L. During 1993–94, 34 water samples from 32 additional sites were analyzed for <sup>129</sup>I to better establish the background concentrations in surface and ground water from the eastern Snake River Plain that is presumed to be unaffected by waste disposal practices at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). Surface water contained larger <sup>129</sup>I concentrations than water from springs and wells contained. Because surface water is more likely to be affected by anthropogenic fallout and evapotranspiration, background <sup>129</sup>I concentrations were estimated in the current research using the laboratory results of ground-water samples that were assumed to be unaffected by INEEL disposal practices.

A paleomagnetic study was conducted on basalt from 41 lava flows represented in about 2,300 ft of core from coreholes ICPP-213, ICPP-214, ICPP-215, and USGS 128. These wells are in the area of the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC) Vadose Zone Research Park within the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). Paleomagnetic measurements were made on 508 samples from the four coreholes, which are compared to each other, and to surface outcrop paleomagnetic data. In general, subhorizontal lines of correlation exist between sediment layers and between basalt layers in the area of the new percolation ponds. Some of the basalt flows and flow sequences are strongly correlative at different depth intervals and represent important stratigraphic unifying elements. Some units pinch out, or thicken or thin even over short separation distances of about 1,500 ft. A more distant correlation of more than 1 mile to corehole USGS 128 is possible for several of the basalt flows, but at greater depth. This is probably due to the broad subsidence of the eastern Snake River Plain centered along its topographic axis located to the south of INEEL. This study shows this most clearly in the oldest portions of the cored sections that have differentially subsided the greatest amount.

## HortnessRousseau2003

Accurate estimates of peak flows in the Big Lost River at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) are needed to assist planners and managers with evaluating possible effects of flooding on facilities at the INEEL. A large difference of 4,350 cubic feet per second (ft<sup>3</sup>/s) between two previous estimates of the magnitude of the 100-year peak flow in the Big Lost River near the western boundary of the INEEL prompted the present study.

Regression models that compared annual peak flows and attenuation of annual peak flows between successive gaging stations for the same flow event were used to estimate the magnitude of the 100-year peak flow in the Big Lost River. The 100-year peak flow of 4,790 ft<sup>3</sup>/s at the Howell Ranch gaging station was used as the starting point for this analysis. This estimate was determined by using a three-parameter log-Pearson Type III distribution as outlined in “Guidelines for Determining Flood Flow Frequency” (Bulletin 17B by the Interagency Advisory Committee on Water Data).

The regression models indicated that, in the reach of the Big Lost River between Howell Ranch and Mackay Reservoir, downstream peak flows are lower than upstream peak flows. Peak-flow attenuation values for this reach of the river decreased nonlinearly as the magnitude of the peak flow increased. Extrapolation of the trend resulted in an attenuation estimate of 13 percent for this reach relative to the 100-year peak flow at the Howell Ranch gaging station.

In the lower reach of the Big Lost River between Mackay Reservoir and Arco, downstream peak flows are also lower than upstream peak flows. However, in contrast to the upper reach, peak-flow attenuation values decreased linearly as the magnitude of the peak flow increased. Extrapolation of the data indicated that peak-flow attenuations in this reach of the river approach zero for flows approaching the 100-year peak-flow estimate immediately upstream and downstream from Mackay Reservoir.

A regression model of annual maximum daily mean flows between Arco and the INEEL diversion dam indicated that the attenuation values in this reach of the river are nearly the same for all flows of record. Extrapolation of the linear regression of these values resulted in an attenuation estimate of 10 percent. Seepage measurements made during 1951–53 also resulted in a loss estimate of approximately 10 percent. This attenuation value, combined with the values from analyses of the upstream reaches, resulted in an estimate of the 100-year peak flow for the Big Lost River immediately upstream from the INEEL diversion dam of 3,750 ft<sup>3</sup>/s; upper and lower 95-percent confidence limits were 6,250 ft<sup>3</sup>/s and 1,300 ft<sup>3</sup>/s, respectively.

Localized rainfall, even of high intensity, is not likely to produce large peak flows at the INEEL because of high loss rates (infiltration, bank storage, and channel storage) along much of the stream channel. The relatively short flow durations resulting from rainstorms historically have not provided sufficient volumes of water to satisfy local storage demands (bank and channel storage). Only after these storage demands are met do the loss rates decrease enough for significant peak flows to reach the INEEL site.

An uncertain component of the present analysis is the effect of seismic activity on the 100-year peak-flow estimate. Analysis of the effect of the magnitude 7.3 Borah Peak earthquake in 1983 on normal flow conditions in the Big Lost River suggests that the joint occurrence of a large earthquake and a 100-year peak flow could significantly increase the magnitude of the peak flow at the INEEL.

## Perkins2003

Disposal of wastewater to unlined infiltration ponds near the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC), formerly known as the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant, at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) has resulted in the formation of perched water bodies in the unsaturated zone (Cecil and others, 1991). The unsaturated zone at INEEL comprises numerous basalt flows interbedded with thinner layers of coarse-to fine-grained sediments and perched ground-water zones exist at various depths associated with massive basalts, basalt-flow contacts, sedimentary interbeds, and sediment-basalt contacts. Perched ground water is believed to result from large infiltration events such as seasonal flow in the Big Lost River and wastewater discharge to infiltration ponds. Evidence from a large-scale tracer experiment conducted in 1999 near the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC), approximately 13 km from the INTEC, indicates that rapid lateral flow of perched water in the unsaturated zone may be an important factor in contaminant transport at the INEEL (Nimmo and others, 2002b). Because sedimentary interbeds, and possibly baked-zone alterations at sediment-basalt contacts (Cecil and other, 1991) play an important role in the generation of perched water it is important to assess the hydraulic properties of these units.

## Scarberry2003

The eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP) volcanic basin in southeast Idaho is underlain by ~1 km of dominantly Pliocene-Quaternary olivine tholeiite basalt and interbedded sediment. The F basalt flow group is a stratigraphic marker bed near the top of the regional aquifer and underlies a portion of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, where radiochemical and chemical wastewater has been discharged to the aquifer. This flow group erupted during an unusual, short-lived period of reversed magnetic polarity ~ 565 ka, probably in ≤ 200 years. This study uses new petrographic, geochemical, and isotopic analyses of the flow group to refine the subsurface stratigraphy. This sequence of lava flows is uneroded, apparently comagmatic, and is observed in drill core over an area of ~ 75 km2 between ~120-220 m depth. Lithologic logs for six sections of F flows in drill-core reveal textural discordance within the sequence and that the thickest (~55 m) lie in the southwest part of the study region and contain an upper portion (~15-23 m) that is texturally coarser and significantly enriched in incompatible elements relative to the remainder of the sequence. In addition, lava flows in the lower sequence have lower initial 87Sr/86Sr isotopic ratios than the upper flows (0.7068 vs. 0.7071) while all exhibit similar 143Nd/144Nd isotope ratios (~0.5124; εNd ~ -4.3). Petrographic, isotopic, and geochemical features support correlations between sampled sections and define two flow groups within the F sequence. Variations in the texture and stratigraphy of the two flow groups indicate that they were derived from multiple coeval eruptive centers aligned along a common rift or fissure system, and not from a central vent complex. The stratigraphy of the entire F sequence is consistent with formation by constructional volcanic processes and is unaffected by post depositional structural offsets.

Snow was sampled and analyzed for total mercury (THg) on the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) and surrounding region prior to the start-up of a large (9-11 g/h) gaseous mercury emission source. The objective was to determine the effects of the source on local and regional atmospheric deposition of mercury. Snow samples collected from 48 points on a polar grid near the source had THg concentrations that ranged from 4.71 to 27.26 ng/L; snow collected from regional background sites had THg concentrations that ranged from 0.89 to 16.61 ng/L. Grid samples had higher concentrations than the regional background sites, which was unexpected because the source was not operating yet. Emission of Hg from soils is a possible source of Hg in snow on the INEEL. Evidence from Hg profiles in snow and from unfiltered/filtered split samples supports this hypothesis. Ongoing work on the INEEL is investigating Hg fluxes from soils and snow.

The U.S. Survey and Idaho State University, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, are conducting studies to describe the chemical character of ground water that moves as underflow from drainage basins into the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer (ESRPA) system at and near the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) and the effects of these recharge waters on the geochemistry of the ESRPA system. Each of these recharge waters has a hydrochemical character related to geochemical processes, especially water-rock interactions, that occur during migration to the ESRPA. Results of these studies will benefit ongoing and planned geochemical modeling of the ESRPA at the INEEL by providing model input on the hydrochemical character of water from each drainage basin.

During 2000, water samples were collected from five wells and one surface-water site in the Birch Creek drainage basin and analyzed for selected inorganic constituents, nutrients, dissolved organic carbon, tritium, measurements of gross alpha and beta radioactivity, and stable isotopes. Four duplicate samples also were collected for quality assurance. Results, which include analyses of samples previously collected from four other sites, in the basin, show that most water from the Birch Creek drainage basin has a calcium-magnesium bicarbonate character.

The Birch Creek Valley can be divided roughly into three hydrologic areas. In the northern part, ground water is forced to the surface by a basalt barrier and the sampling sites were either surface water or shallow wells. Water chemistry in this area was characterized by simple evaporation models, simple calcite-carbon dioxide models, or complex models involving carbonate and silicate minerals. The central part of the valley is filled by sedimentary material and the sampling sites were wells that are deeper than those in the northern part. Water chemistry in this area was characterized by simple calcite-dolomite-carbon dioxide models. In the southern part, ground water enters the ESRPA. In this area, the sampling sites were wells with depths and water levels much deeper than those in the northern and central parts of the valley. The calcium and carbon water chemistry in this area was characterized by a simple calcite-carbon dioxide model, but complex calcite-silicate models more accurately accounted for mass transfer in these areas.

Throughout the geochemical system, calcite precipitated if it was an active phase in the models. Carbon dioxide either precipitated (outgassed) or dissolved depending on the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in water from the modeled sites. Dolomite was an active phase only in models from the central part of the system. Generally the entire geochemical system could be modeled with either evaporative models, carbonate models, or carbonate-silicate models. In both of the latter types of models, a significant amount of calcite precipitated relative to the mass transfer to and from the other active phases. The amount of calcite precipitated in the more complex models was consistent with the amount of calcite precipitated in the simpler models. This consistency suggests that, although the simpler models can predict calcium and carbon concentrations in Birch Creek Valley ground and surface water, silicate-mineral-based models are required to account for the other constituents. The amount of mass transfer to and from the silicate mineral phases was generally small compared with that in the carbonate phases. It appears that the water chemistry of well USGS 126B represents the chemistry of water recharging the ESRPA by means of underflow from the Birch Creek Valley.

The U.S. Geological Survey and the Idaho Department of Water Resources, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, sampled water from 16 of 18 sites as part of the fifth round of a long-term project to monitor water quality of the Snake River Plain aquifer from the southern boundary of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory to the Hagerman area. The samples were collected from eight irrigation wells, four domestic wells, two stock wells, one spring, and one public supply well and analyzed for selected radiochemical and chemical constituents. Two sites were not sampled because one was decommissioned and the other was discontinued due to a change in the well owner. Two quality-assurance replicate samples also were collected and analyzed. Tritium analyses from 19 spring samples collected along the Snake River in the Twin Falls-Hagerman area also are presented within this report along with two replicate quality assurance samples.

None of the reported radiochemical or chemical constituent concentrations exceeded the established maximum contaminant levels for drinking water. Many of the radionuclide- and inorganic-constituent concentrations were greater than the respective minimum reporting levels. Most of the organic-constituent concentrations were less than the minimum reporting levels.

The subsurface at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) is complex, comprised primarily of thick, fractured basalt flows interbedded with thinner sedimentary intervals. The unsaturated zone can be as thick as 200 m in the southwestern part of the INEEL. The Vadose Zone Research Park (VZRP), located approximately 10 km southwest of the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC), was established in 2001 to study the subsurface of a relatively undisturbed part of the INEEL. Waste percolation ponds for the INTEC were relocated to the VZRP due to concerns that perched water within the vadose zone under the original infiltration ponds (located immediately south of the INTEC) could contribute to migration of contaminants to the Snake River Plain aquifer.

Knowledge of the spatial distribution of texture and hydraulic properties is important for developing a better understanding of subsurface flow processes within the interbeds, for example, by identifying low permeability layers that could lead to the formation of perched ground-water zones. Because particle-size distributions are easier to measure than hydraulic properties, particle size serves as an analog for determining how the unsaturated hydraulic properties vary both vertically within particular interbeds and laterally within the VZRP. As part of the characterization program for the subsurface at the VZRP, unsaturated and saturated hydraulic properties were measured on 10 core samples from six boreholes. Bulk properties, including particle size, bulk density, particle density, and specific surface area, were determined on material from the same depth intervals as the core samples, with an additional 66 particle-size distributions measured on bulk samples from the same boreholes.

From lithologic logs of the 32 boreholes at the VZRP, three relatively thick interbeds (in places up to 10 m thick) were identified at depths of 35, 45, and 55 m below land surface. The 35-m interbed extends laterally over a distance of at least 900 m from the Big Lost River to the new percolation pond area of the VZRP. Most wells within the VZRP were drilled to depths less than 50 m, making it difficult to infer the lateral extent of the 45-m and 55-m interbeds. The 35-m interbed is uniform in texture both vertically and laterally; the 45-m interbed coarsens upward; and the 55-m interbed contains alternating coarse and fine layers. Seventy-one out of 90 samples were silt loams and 9 out of 90 samples were classified as either sandy loams, loamy sands, or sands. The coarsest samples were located within the 45-m and 55-m interbeds of borehole ICPP-SCI-V-215, located near the southeast corner of the new percolation pond area.

At the tops of some interbeds, baked-zone intervals were identified by their oxidized color (yellowish red to red) compared to the color of the underlying non-baked material (pale yellow to brown). The average geometric mean particle diameter of baked-zone intervals was only slightly coarser, in some cases, than the underlying non-baked sediment. This is likely due to both depositional differences between the top and bottom of the interbeds and the presence of small basalt clasts in the sediment. Core sample hydraulic properties from baked zones within the different interbeds did not show effects from alteration caused during basalt deposition, but differed mainly by texture.

Saturated hydraulic conductivities (Ksat) for the 10 core samples ranged from 10-7 to 10-4 cm/s. Low permeability layers, with Ksat values less than 10-7 cm/s, within the 35-m and 45-m interbeds may cause perched ground-water zones to form beneath the new percolation pond area, leading to the possible lateral movement of water away from the VZRP.

The U.S. Geological Survey, in response to a request from the U.S. Department of Energy's Pittsburgh Naval Reactors Office, Idaho Branch Office, sampled water from 13 wells during 2000 as part of a long-term project to monitor water quality of the Snake River Plain aquifer in the vicinity of the Naval Reactors Facility, Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, Idaho. Water samples were analyzed for naturally occurring constituents and anthropogenic contaminants. A total of 52 samples were collected from the 13 monitoring wells. The routine samples contained detectable concentrations of total cations and dissolved anions, and nitrite plus nitrate as nitrogen. Most of the samples also contained detectable concentrations of gross alpha- and gross beta-particle radioactivity and tritium. Eight quality-assurance samples also were collected and analyzed; four were field-blank samples, and four were replicate samples. Most of the field-blank samples contained less-than-detectable concentrations of target constituents.

Lower Pleistocene lacustrine sediments constrained by the Olduvai normal-polarity subchron (1.95-1.77 Ma), in Coreholes WO-2, 2-2A, and C-IA at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, within the Big Lost Trough sub-basin of the Eastern Snake River Plain, Idaho, demonstrate the presence of a regionally extensive lake, tenned Olduvai Lake. Olduvai Lake sediments occur at substantially different elevations in three coreholes. There is three hundred and ninety-five feet (120.4m) elevation difference between C-IA and WO-2, and six hundred and ninety-eight feet (212.8 m) elevation difference between WO-2 and 2-2A. This indicates post-depositional deformation consistent with one or more of the following explanations: flexure from mid-crustal loading, rapid sedimentation followed by valley-cutting and subsequent infilling with basalt flows, or deposition across an active or subsequently-active fault associated with a buried caldera or buried Basin and Range-style nonnal faults. Offset across Basin and Range nonnal faults is the favored hypothesis. Extensive grainsize analysis, performed on a Beckman-Coulter LS230 Particle-Size Analyzer, reveals that the majority of subsurface sediments are poorly to very poorly sorted and are generally fine-sand to clay-sized. Calculated hydraulic conductivity values (using measured grainsizes and assumed porosities of twenty and forty percent) differ considerably from measured values, none-the-less sediments should have low hydraulic conductivity values because of their silt and clay effective grainsize. Thus, the vast majority of recovered sediments should act as semi-confining layers to groundwater flow and contaminant migration, relative to highly permeable basalt fractures and rubble zones. Overall, Pliocene-Pleistocene sedimentation at the INEEL reflects lacustrine dominated sedimentation from c.a. 2.5 to 3 Ma through Olduvai time (1.77 Ma) (Idaho Group: Pillow Lake and Olduvai Lake beds), followed by a shift to playa, fluvial, and eolian-dominated depositional environments, which have persisted to modem times (Snake River Group).

The search for extraterrestrial life may be facilitated if ecosystems can be found on Earth that exist under conditions analogous to those present on other planets or moons. It has been proposed, on the basis of geochemical and thermodynamic considerations, that geologically derived hydrogen might support subsurface microbial communities on Mars and Europa in which methanogens form the base of the ecosystem. Here we describe a unique subsurface microbial community in which hydrogen-consuming, methane-producing Archaea far outnumber the Bacteria. More than 90% of the 16S ribosomal DNA sequences recovered from hydrothermal waters circulating through deeply buried igneous rocks in Idaho are related to hydrogen-using methanogenic microorganisms. Geochemical characterization indicates that geothermal hydrogen, not organic carbon, is the primary energy source for this methanogen-dominated microbial community. These results demonstrate that hydrogen-based methanogenic communities do occur in Earth's subsurface, providing an analogue for possible subsurface microbial ecosystems on other planets.

To investigate possible long-range flow paths through the interbedded basalts and sediments of a 200-m-thick unsaturated zone, we applied a chemical tracer to seasonally filled infiltration ponds on the Snake River Plain in Idaho. This site is near the Subsurface Disposal Area for radioactive and other hazardous waste at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. Within 4 mo, we detected tracer in one of 13 sampled aquifer wells, and in eight of 11 sampled perched-water wells as far as 1.3 km away. These detections show that (i) low-permeability layers in the unsaturated zone divert some flow horizontally, but do not prevent rapid transport to the aquifer; (ii) horizontal convective transport rates within the unsaturated zone may exceed 14 m d−1, perhaps through essentially saturated basalt fractures, tension cracks, lava tubes, or rubble zones; and (iii) some perched water beneath the Subsurface Disposal Area derives from episodic surface water more than 1 km away. Such rapid and far-reaching flow may be common throughout the Snake River Plain, and possibly occurs in other locations that have a geologically complex unsaturated zone and comparable sources of infiltrating water.

A series of geophysical experiments were conducted over an area of known dikes, fissures, and lava tubes along the Great Rift volcanic rift zone in the eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP) of Idaho in order to determine if microgravity and ground-based magnetic data can identify these features. A total of four microgravity profiles and ten magnetic profiles were acquired over the Kings Bowl lava field and surrounding older basalt flows. Two microgravity profiles and four magnetic profiles were also acquired over a lava tube known as Bear Trap Cave.

Once acquired, the gravity data were reduced using standard reduction procedures including earth tide and terrain corrections. Subsurface density and magnetic susceptibility/remanence models were then generated for each short profile (<200 meters in length) focusing on the contributions from near surface bodies such as lava tubes, fissures, and shallow dikes, as well as other lateral variations in basalt density and magnetization. Three long profile models (< 6 km in length) were also generated, which focused on the contributions from deep bodies such as dike swarms. The data were then gridded and contoured to create magnetic and gravity anomaly maps for both the Kings Bowl and Bear Trap Cave study areas.

A distinct gravity low and magnetic low with flanking highs are observed over Bear Trap Cave lava tube. These anomalies decrease in amplitude to the southwest as the lava tube deepens and narrows. The anomalies are more distinct on the gravity data than the magnetic data. Interpretation of the long profile microgravity models and the residual Bouguer gravity anomaly map for the Kings Bowl study area indicate that a broad, low amplitude, local gravity high associated with interpreted deeper dike swarms exists over the main Kings Bowl eruptive fissure. A magnetic anomaly associated with this deeper dike swarm does not stand out on the long magnetic profiles or models. A linear, low amplitude magnetic high correlates between three, closely spaced profiles as they cross the main eruptive fissure, but does not extend north, or south, along the eruptive fissure in adjacent profiles. Therefore, the observed linear high is likely the result of locally highly magnetized surficial basalts in the area, and not the result of a mafic dike at depth. In addition, short wavelength variations occur in the observed magnetic and microgravity data that do not seem to be related to dikes, fissures, or lava tubes. This indicates that near surface basalt flows along the ESRP display rapid horizontal changes in density and magnetic susceptibility/remanence. Since basalt density, and possibly magnetic susceptibility/remanence, can be correlated with vessicularity and porosity, then techniques employed in this study may be used to model lateral porosity changes within, and between, basalt flows along the ESRP.

## SwansonOthers2002

The U.S. Geological Survey and Idaho State University, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, are conducting studies to describe the chemical character of ground water that moves as underflow from drainage basins into the Snake River Plain aquifer (SRPA) system at and near the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) and the effects of these recharge waters on the geochemistry of the SRPA system. Each of these recharge waters has a hydrochemical character related to geochemical processes, especially water-rock interactions, that occur during migration to the SRPA. Results of these studies will benefit ongoing and planned geochemical modeling of the SRPA at the INEEL by providing model input on the hydrochemical character of water from each drainage basin.

For this study, water samples were collected from six wells and two surface-water sites from the Little Lost River drainage basin during 2000 and analyzed for selected inorganic constituents, dissolved organic carbon, stable isotopes, tritium, and selected gross measurements of radioactivity. Four duplicate samples were collected for quality assurance. Results showed that most water from the Little Lost River drainage basin has a calcium-magnesium bicarbonate character. Water in two wells contained elevated chloride concentrations relative to water from the other sites. The computer code NETPATH was used to evaluate geochemical mass-balance reactions in the Little Lost River basin. Attempts to model water from the Little Lost River valley sites to that in the most downgradient wells, Mays and Ruby Farms, were unsuccessful. On closer inspection of these two wells, it was determined that they are much deeper than the other sample locations and the water could reflect the chemistry of the SRPA. Apparently another of the sample locations was contaminated as a result of local agricultural practices. Water in one well contained concentrations that mirrored Little Lost River water. Of all the sites sampled, only two upgradient wells contained water representative of the system. Mass-balance modeling of the system indicated that dissolution of dolomite is the major reaction taking place in the system. Nitrification of ammonium ion to nitrate and dissolution of inorganic fertilizers are chemical processes that also occur in the system. To better understand the geochemistry of the Little Lost River drainage basin, more samples that better represent the natural geochemistry of the basin need to be collected and evaluated.

## Twining2002

During 1994-99, the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, collected samples for tritium analyses from 19 springs along the north side of the Snake River near Twin Falls and Hagerman, Idaho, to address public concern over migration of approximately 31,000 Ci of tritium discharged in wastewater at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). Evaluating tritium for the Twin Falls-Hagerman area is part of a long-term project to monitor water quality of springs discharging from the Snake River Plain aquifer downgradient from the INEEL. Routine and two quality-assurance replicate samples have been collected annually since 1990 as part of the U.S. Geological Survey's quality-assurance program.

The springs were characterized on the basis of their locations and tritium concentrations: Category I, II, and III. The differences in tritium concentrations in Category I, II, and III springs are a function of the ground-water flow regimes, land uses, and irrigation practices in and hydraulically upgradient from each category of springs. Tritium concentrations during the 1994-99 water years ranged from a low 6.5±0.6 picocuries per liter (pCi/L) to a high of 65.0±4.5 pCi/L. During 1999, tritium concentrations in the 19 springs ranged from 6.5±0.6 pCi/L to 46.1±3.2 pCi/L. Mean annual tritium concentrations measured from 1990 to 1999 in selected springs from each category show decreasing trends in tritium values, likely the result of natural isotope decay.

The samples were analyzed for selected radiochemical and chemical constituents. The samples were collected from five domestic wells, eight irrigation wells, two springs, one dairy well, one stock well, and one observation well. Two quality-assurance replicate samples also were collected and analyzed. Tritium analyses from 18 spring samples collected along the Snake River in the Twin Falls-Hagerman area also are presented.

None of the reported radiochemical or chemical constituent concentrations exceeded the established maximum contaminant levels for drinking water. Many of the radionuclide- and inorganic-constituent concentrations were greater than the respective minimum reporting levels. Most of the organic-constituent concentrations were less than the minimum reporting levels.

## BusenbergOthers2001

The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, used concentrations of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), sulfur hexafluoride, helium (He), and tritium (3H) to determine the estimated age of the young fraction of ground water at and near the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). These environmental tracers were introduced into the Snake River Plain aquifer by natural recharge, return flow of irrigation water, and wastewater disposal at facilities at the INEEL. The source of the water and the fraction of young water in the samples also were used to date the ground water. The data indicate that most ground-water samples are mixtures containing young fractions of water recharged after 1950 and older regional ground water.

Data indicate that water in samples from wells in the southeastern part of the INEEL are a binary mixture of local recharge and very old regional ground water, and samples from most of the wells are about 20 to 50 percent young water that is about 14 to 21 years old. Two main mechanisms of recharge of the young fraction of ground water were recognized in samples from the northern part of the INEEL: (1) water recharged by rapid focused recharge through the thick unsaturated zone and (2) water recharged by slow infiltration through the thick unsaturated zone. Some of the wells in the northern part of the INEEL contained all old regional water. Three wells in the northeastern part of the INEEL contained water that was strongly affected by agricultural practices and likely was recharged in the Terreton-Mud Lake area. This water was present in wells 4, 27, and 29 and had estimated ages of5, 10-13, and 24-28 years, respectively.

Water samples from wells that contained a young fraction of water that recharged in the central, western, and southwestern parts of the INEEL are complex mixtures of regional ground water, agricultural return flow, natural recharge, and artificial recharge from infiltration ponds and injection wells at the various facilities at the INEEL. The chemistry and age of the young fraction of the samples varied greatly and could be correlated with distance from the source of recharge, depth of the open interval below the water table, length of the interval sampled, and location of the well with respect to the different sources of recharge. Age increased with distance from the source of recharge and increased with depth below the water table. The young recharge water composes a very small fraction of the total volume of water in the Snake River Plain aquifer, and this young water was sampled because most of the wells at and near the INEEL are completed in the upper 15 m of the aquifer.

Concentrations of fluoride (F), boron, lithium (Li), strontium, oxygen isotope ratios (8ISQ), dissolved atmospheric gases, He, and 3H, were used to determine the sources of water in the Snake River Plain aquifer at and near the INEEL. Three natural ground-water types were identified from their He, Li, and F concentrations: (1) northeastern regional water with very high He, Li, and F concentrations; (2) recharge from the southeast with moderate He and high Li and F concentrations; (3) recharge from mountain valleys in the western part of the INEEL with low concentrations of He and Li and high concentrations of Ca, Mg, and alkalinity. The water was modified locally by mixing with agricultural runoff and wastewater from INEEL facilities. 8ISQ ratios were used to calculate the fraction of young water in the samples from the western part of the INEEL. Terrigenic He and 3H concentrations were used to calculate the fraction of infiltration recharge at the INEEL.

A preferential ground-water flowpath that extends from the Little Lost River and Big Lost River Sinks southward through central INEEL past Big Southern Butte was identified. Flow velocities were estimated from tritium/helium ages and were about 3 m per day through the preferential flowpath. Flow velocities decreased to 1 m or less per day outside this preferential flowpath.

In areas where fractured basalts are exposed at the surface, both tritium and CFCs were present in the ground water. The presence of these constituents indicates that focused recharge of post-1950s infiltration water occurred along preferential flow paths through the unsaturated zone. This type of recharge was recognized in many areas at and near the INEEL.

Recharge temperatures were calculated from nitrogen and argon concentrations for many of the ground-water samples and are useful indicators of the source of water in the Snake River Plain aquifer at the INEEL. Recharge temperatures of about 6 degrees Celsius CCC) characterize underflow from Birch and Camas Creeks and Little Lost and Big Lost Rivers. Recharge temperatures of 9 to 13 oc were calculated for the regional ground water of the Snake River Plain aquifer at the INEEL.

Ground water near the Radioactive Waste Management Complex, the Test Reactor Area, and the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC) contains concentrations of CFCs that are indicative of contamination. A large CFC-12 waste plume originating near the INTEC extends beyond the southern boundary of the INEEL.

Water in wells that are cased a few tens of meters below the water table contained no halocarbons, except for water in wells downgradient from injection wells. Greater-than-atmospheric concentrations of CFCs and other halocarbons were found in soil gases obtained from a depth of 1 m as far as 20 km south of the southwest comer of the INEEL. High concentrations of halocarbons also were found in unsaturated-zone air blowing from the annulus of some wells in the southwestern part of the INEEL. The advective transport of CFCs and other halocarbons throughout the unsaturated zone probably occurs preferentially both vertically and horizontally along fractures associated with volcanic vent corridors. Barometric pumping appears to be the primary mechanism controlling the distribution of gases in the unsaturated zone in the southwestern part of the EEL. Diffusion is the primary mechanism of gas transport in the northern and northeastern part of the INEEL in the areas that are covered by thick lacustrine and sedimentary playa deposits.

The U.S. Geological Survey and Idaho State University, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, are conducting studies to describe the chemical character of ground water that moves as underflow from drainage basins into the Snake River Plain aquifer (SRPA) system at and near the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) and the effects of these recharge waters on the geochemistry of the SRPA system. Each of these recharge waters has a hydrochemical character related to geochemical processes, especially water-rock interactions that occur during migration to the SRPA. Results of these studies will benefit ongoing and planned geochemical modeling of the SRPA at the INEEL by providing model input on the hydrochemical character of water-from each drainage basin.

For this study, water samples were collected from 10 wells in the Big Lost River drainage basin during 1999 and analyzed for selected inorganic constituents, dissolved organic carbon, stable isotopes, tritium, and selected gross measurements of radioactivity. One additional sample was collected as a quality-assurance replicate. Results show that water from the Big Lost River drainage basin has a calcium-magnesium bicarbonate character. The computer code NETPATH was used to evaluate geochemical mass-balance reactions in the Big Lost River basin. Chemical reactions of water with calcite, dolomite, and carbon dioxide gas were considered the dominant reactions. The Arco City well is the farthest downgradient well sampled in the basin, and water from this well can be geochemically modeled from water in upgradient wells. However, the Arco City well is 250 feet deep, and water from it could represent only the deep underflow into the SRPA. Water from the Owen well (114 feet deep) could better represent the shallow underflow into the SRPA; therefore, a combination of water from these two wells could represent the total underflow from the Big Lost River drainage basin into the SRPA. If a 50-percent contribution of water from both wells is assumed, Big Lost River basin recharge to the SRPA would contain 61 milligrams per liter (mg/L) calcium, 14.5 mg/L magnesium, 6.6 mg/L sodium, 1.2 mg/L potassium, 15.5 mg/L silica, 0.2 mg/L fluoride, 6.4 mg/L chloride, 232 mg/L bicarbonate, and 21.5 mg/L sulfate.

This report presents chemical compositions determined from 25 solid-phase samples from the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer system and contributing drainages. Seven samples were collected at selected depths from 6 coreholes located on or near the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, Idaho, and from 18 outcrops in the recharge areas of the Snake River Plain aquifer. This report was prepared by the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, Idaho Operations Office.

Ten major elements, as many as 28 trace elements, and the amount of volatile material were determined for each sample by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy, instrumental neutron activation analysis, loss on ignition, or ion-selective electrode potentiometry.

Idaho State University and the US Geological Survey, in cooperation with the US Department of Energy, conducted a study to determine and evaluate strontium distribution coefficients (K<sub>d</sub>s) of subsurface materials at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). The K<sub>d</sub>s were determined to aid in assessing the variability of strontium K<sub>d</sub>s and their effects on chemical transport of strontium-90 in the Snake River Plain aquifer system. Data from batch experiments done to determine strontium K<sub>d</sub>s of five sediment-infill samples and six standard reference material samples were analyzed by using multiple linear regression analysis and the stepwise variable-selection method in the statistical program, Statistical Product and Service Solutions, to derive an equation of variables that can be used to predict strontium K<sub>d</sub>s of sediment-infill samples. The sediment-infill samples were from basalt vesicles and fractures from a selected core at the INEEL; strontium K<sub>d</sub>s ranged from ~201 to 356 ml g<sup>–1</sup>. The standard material samples consisted of clay minerals and calcite. The statistical analyses of the batch-experiment results showed that the amount of strontium in the initial solution, the amount of manganese oxide in the sample material, and the amount of potassium in the initial solution are the most important variables in predicting strontium K<sub>d</sub>s of sediment-infill samples.

Radiochemical and chemical wastes generated at facilities at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) have been discharged to infiltration ponds at the Test Reactor Area (TRA) and the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC) and buried at the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC) since 1952. Disposal of wastewater to ponds and infiltration of surface water at waste burial sites have resulted in formation of perched ground water in basalts and in sedimentary interbeds above the Snake River Plain aquifer. Perched ground water is an integral part of the pathway for waste-constituent migration to the aquifer.

The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, maintains a continuous monitoring network at the INEEL to determine hydrologic trends and to monitor the movement of wastewater discharged from facilities. This report presents an analysis of water-level and water-quality data collected from perched ground water at the INEEL during 1996-98.

During 1996-98, tritium concentrations in water from wells completed in deep perched ground water at the TRA generally decreased or were variable. During 1998, concentrations ranged from less than the reporting level to 116±4 picocuries per milliliter (pCi/mL). Tritium concentrations in water from wells at the TRA were affected by distance of the well from the radioactive-waste ponds, depth of the water below the ponds, the amount of tritium discharged to the radioactive-waste ponds in the past, discontinued use of the radioactive-waste ponds, radioactive decay, and dilution from nonradioactive water.

During 1996-98, strontium-90 concentrations in water from wells completed in deep perched ground water at the TRA were variable. During October 1998, concentrations ranged from less than the reporting level to 59±2 picocuries per liter (pCi/L). Cesium-137 and cobalt-60 were detected in water from a shallow well near the radioactive-waste pond retention basin.

Dissolved chromium concentrations in perched ground water at the TRA during 1998 ranged from less than 14 to 98 micrograms per liter. The largest concentrations were in water from wells north and west of the radioactive-waste ponds. Dissolved sodium concentrations ranged from 6.1 to 1,000 milligrams per liter (mg/L) in 1998. Dissolved sulfate concentrations ranged from 18 to 3,200 mg/L. The largest concentrations of sodium and sulfate were in water from a well near the chemical-waste pond.

During 1996-98, tritium concentrations in water from wells completed in deep perched ground water near the INTEC infiltration ponds generally decreased because of decreased disposal; strontium-90 concentrations were variable. In October 1998, tritium concentrations ranged from less than the reporting level to 9.7±0.5 pCi/mL; strontium-90 concentrations ranged from less than the reporting level to 2.8±0.6 pCi/L.

During 1996-98, concentrations of sodium, chloride, and sulfate in water from wells completed in perched ground water near the INTEC infiltration ponds were similar to the concentrations of the constituents in the wastewater discharged. During 1996-98, concentrations of selected radiochemical constituents were below the reporting level in all samples from a well completed in perched ground water at the RWMC. Samples contained concentrations greater than the reporting levels of 14 different purgeable organic compounds.

Most of the samples also had detectable concentrations of gross alpha- and gross beta-particle radioactivity and tritium. Fourteen quality-assurance samples also were collected and analyzed; seven were field-blank samples, and seven were replicate samples. Most of the field blank samples contained less than detectable concentrations of target constituents; however, some blank samples did contain detectable concentrations of calcium, magnesium, barium, copper, manganese, nickel, zinc, nitrite plus nitrate, total organic halogens, tritium, and selected volatile organic compounds.

Radiochemical and chemical wastewater discharged since 1952 to infiltration ponds and disposal wells at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) has affected water quality in the Snake River Plain aquifer. The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, maintains a monitoring network at the INEEL to determine hydrologic trends and to delineate the movement of radiochemical and chemical wastes in the aquifer. This report presents an analysis of water-level and water-quality data collected from the Snake River Plain aquifer during 1996-98.

Water in the Snake River Plain aquifer moves principally through fractures and interflow zones in basalt, generally flows southwestward, and eventually discharges at springs along the Snake River. The aquifer is recharged principally from infiltration of irrigation water, infiltration of streamflow, and ground-water inflow from adjoining mountain drainage basins. Water levels in wells throughout the INEEL generally increased during 1996-98.

Detectable concentrations of radiochemical constituents in water samples from wells in the Snake River Plain aquifer at the INEEL decreased or remained constant during 1996-98. Decreased concentrations are attributed to reduced rates of radioactive-waste disposal, sorption processes, radioactive decay, and changes in waste-disposal practices. Tritium concentrations in water samples decreased as much as 9.3 picocuries per milliliter (pCi/mL) during 1996-98 and ranged from 0.2910.06 to 18.710.8 pCi/mL in 1998. Strontium-90 concentrations remained constant or decreased during 1996-98 and ranged from 2.110.6 to 41.111.5 picocuries per liter in 1998. During 1996-98, the concentrations of cobalt-60, cesium-137, americium-241, plutonium-238, and plutonium-239, -240 (undivided) in water samples from all wells sampled at the INEEL were below the reporting level.

Detectable concentrations of chemical constituents in water from the Snake River Plain aquifer at the INEEL were variable during 1996-98. In 1998, water from one well south of the Test Reactor Area contained 168 micrograms per liter (mg/L) of dissolved chromium; other water samples contained from less than 14 to 26 ug/L. Sodium and chloride concentrations in the southern part of the INEEL increased slightly or remained constant during 1996-98 because of long-term increased waste-disposal rates. Nitrate concentrations remained relatively constant or decreased during 1996-98 because of decreases in disposal rates and dilution by recharge water.

During 1996-98, concentrations of 1 to 12 purgeable organic compounds were detected in water from wells at the INEEL. Concentrations of 1,1,1-trichloroethane were above the reporting level in all three wells sampled near the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center. Concentrations of several purgeable organic compounds exceeded their reporting levels in wells at or near the Radioactive Waste Management Complex because of waste-disposal practices.

From May 1994 through May 1997, the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, collected water samples from 86 wells completed in the Snake River Plain aquifer at and near the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. The samples were analyzed for a variety of chemical constituents including all major elements and 22 trace elements. Concentrations of scandium, yttrium, and the lanthanide series were measured in samples from 11 wells and 1 hot spring. The data will be used to determine the fraction of young water in the ground water. The fraction of young water must be known to calculate the ages of the ground water using chlorofluorocarbons. The concentrations of the isotopes deuterium, oxygen-18, carbon-13, carbon-14, and tritium were measured in many ground water, surface-water and spring samples. The isotopic composition will provide clues to the origin and sources of water in the Snake River Plain aquifer. Concentrations of helium-3, helium-4, total helium, and neon were measured in most ground-water samples, and the results will be used to determine the recharge temperature, and to date the ground waters.

One way to study Earth’s past environmental conditions is to look at ice cores recovered from glaciers. Every year a layer of snow accumulates on glaciers, like a page in a history book, and eventually turns to ice. Like reading the pages of a history book, analyzing the layers in a glacial ice core for specific chemical and physical components is a way of “reading” the environmental changes of the past. Information from ice cores collected from Greenland and Antarctica already has provided important historical clues toward a better understanding of modern global environmental changes (Dansgaard and Oeschger, 1989; Lorius and others, 1989). Environmental changes are of major concern at low- or mid-latitude regions of our Earth simply because this is where 80 to 90 percent of the world’s human population live. Ice cores collected from isolated polar regions are, at best, proxy indicators of low- and mid-latitude environmental changes. Because polar ice core research is limiting in this sense, ice cores from low- and mid-latitude glaciers are being used to study past environmental changes in order to better understand and predict future environmental changes that may affect the populated regions of the world.

In situ chlorine-36 (<sup>36</sup>Cl) production resulting from nuclear interactions between nonradioactive (stable) nuclides and particles given off during the radioactive transformation of uranium (U) and thorium (Th) decay-series isotopes was determined for 25 whole-rock samples collected from 6 major water-bearing rock types in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer. The rock types investigated were basalt, rhyolite, limestone, dolomite, shale, and quartzite. Calculated ratios of <sup>36</sup>Cl/Cl in these rocks, as a result of neutron activation of stable chlorine-35, ranged from 1.4×10<sup>15</sup> (basalt) to 45×10<sup>15</sup> (rhyolite). The associated neutron production rates calculated for these rock types were 2.5 neutrons per gram of rock per year [(n/g)/yr] for the basalt and 29 (n/g)/yr for the rhyolite. The larger neutron production rate for the rhyolite is due to the larger U (11.5 parts per million, ppm) and Th (22.2 ppm) concentration of the rhyolite; for comparison, the U and Th concentrations of the basalt were 0.8 and 2.23 ppm, respectively.

When the chloride (Cl) concentration and rock porosity are considered with the calculated <sup>36</sup>Cl/Cl ratios, the estimated maximum corrected concentrations of <sup>36</sup>Cl in ground water associated with the 6 rock types analyzed in this study ranged from 2.45×10<sup>5</sup> atoms per liter (atoms/L) for ground water in the basalt to 7.68×10<sup>6</sup> atoms/L for ground water in the rhyolite. These values are at least seven orders of magnitude smaller than concentrations measured in groundwater at and near the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). A <sup>36</sup>Cl concentration of 15±0.1×10<sup>12</sup> atoms/L has been reported for a ground-water sample collected near the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center, a nuclear-waste processing facility at the INEEL. Additionally, in situ <sup>36</sup>Cl/Cl ratios in ground water from rock with average compositions from this study ranged from 4.0×10<sup>-15</sup> to 33.3×10<sup>-15</sup>. For comparison, the range of <sup>36</sup>Cl/Cl for 254 ground-water samples collected from the Snake River Plain aquifer at and near the INEEL was 31×10<sup>-15</sup> to 2.9×10<sup>-9</sup>.

Determining the contribution of in situ production to <sup>36</sup>Cl inventories in ground water facilitated the identification of the source for this radionuclide in environmental samples. On the basis of calculations reported here, in situ production of <sup>36</sup>Cl was determined to be insignificant compared to concentrations measured in ground water near buried and injected nuclear waste at the INEEL. Maximum estimated <sup>36</sup>Cl concentrations in ground water from in situ production are on the same order of magnitude as natural concentrations in meteoric water.

Chlorine-36 (<sup>36</sup>Cl) derived from processed nuclear waste that was disposed at the US Department of Energy's Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) through a deep injection well in 1958, was detected 24-28 yr later in groundwater monitoring wells approximately 26 km downgradient from the source. Groundwater samples covering the period 1966-1995 were selected from the US Geological Survey's archived-sample library at the INEEL and analyzed for <sup>36</sup>Cl by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). The smaller <sup>36</sup>Cl peak concentrations in water from the far-field monitoring wells relative to the input suggest that aquifer dispersivity may be large. However, the sharpness of the 1958 disposal peak of <sup>36</sup>Cl is matched by the measured <sup>36</sup>Cl concentrations in water from these wells. This implies that a small aquifer dispersivity may be attributed to preferential groundwater flowpaths. Assuming that tracer arrival times at monitoring wells are controlled by preferential flow, a 1-D system-response model was used to estimate dispersivity by comparing the shape of predicted <sup>36</sup>Cl-concentration curves to the shape of <sup>36</sup>Cl-concentration curves measured in water from these observation wells. The comparisons suggest that a 1-D dispersivity of 5 m provides the best fit to the tracer data. Previous work using a 2-D equivalent porous-media model concluded that longitudinal dispersivity (equivalent to 1-D dispersivity in our model) was 90 m (Ackerman, 1991). A 90 m dispersivity value eliminates the 1958 disposal peak in our model output curves. The implications of the arrival of <sup>36</sup>Cl at downgradient monitoring wells are important for three reasons: (1) the arrival times and associated <sup>36</sup>Cl concentrations provide quantitative constraints on residence times, velocities, and dispersivities in the aquifer; (2) they help to refine our working hypotheses of groundwater flow in this aquifer and (3) they may suggest a means of estimating the distribution of preferential flowpaths in the aquifer.

## JohnsonOthers2000

Preferential flow paths are expected in many groundwater systems and must be located because they can greatly affect contaminant transport. The fundamental characteristics of radio-genic isotope ratios in chemically evolving waters make them highly effective as preferential flowpath indicators. These ratios tend to be more easily interpreted than solute-concentration data because their response to water-rock interaction is less complex. We demonstrate this approach with groundwater 87Sr/86Sr ratios in the Snake River Plain aquifer within and near the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. These data reveal slow-flow zones as lower 87Sr/86Sr areas created by prolonged interaction with the host basalts and a relatively fast flowing zone as a high 87Sr/86Sr area.

## LiszewskiOthers2000

The U.S. Geological Survey and Idaho State University, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, conducted a study to determine strontium distribution coefficients (K<sub>d</sub>s) of surficial sediments at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). Batch experiments using synthesized aqueous solutions were used to determine K<sub>d</sub>s, which describe the distribution of a solute between the solution and solid phase, of 20 surficial-sediment samples from the INEEL. The K<sub>d</sub>s for the 20 surficial-sediment samples ranged from 36 to 275 ml/g. Many properties of both the synthesized aqueous solutions and sediments used in the experiments also were determined. Solution properties determined were initial and equilibrium concentrations of calcium, magnesium, and strontium, pH and specific conductance, and initial concentrations of potassium and sodium. Sediment properties determined were grain-size distribution, bulk mineralogy, whole-rock major-oxide and strontium and barium concentrations, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area. Solution and sediment properties were correlated with strontium K<sub>d</sub>s of the 20 surficial sediments using Pearson correlation coefficients. Solution properties with the strongest correlations with strontium K<sub>d</sub>s were equilibrium pH and equilibrium calcium concentration correlation coefficients, 0.6598 and –0.6518, respectively. Sediment properties with the strongest correlations with strontium K<sub>d</sub>s were manganese oxide (MnO), BET surface area, and the >4.75-mm-grain-size fraction correlation coefficients, 0.7054, 0.7022, and –0.6660, respectively. Effects of solution properties on strontium K<sub>d</sub>s were interpreted as being due to competition among similarly charged and sized cations in solution for strontium-sorption sites; effects of sediment properties on strontium K<sub>d</sub>s were interpreted as being surface-area related. Multivariate analyses of these solution and sediment properties resulted in r<sup>2</sup> values of 0.8071 when all five properties were used and 0.8043 when three properties, equilibrium pH, MnO, and BET surface area, were used.

The intensely layered character of the 200-m thick unsaturated zone near the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC) Subsurface Disposal Area (SDA) at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) critically affects both vertical and horizontal water fluxes. Because of the potential for radionuclide migration from the SDA to the Snake River Plain aquifer, it is important to investigate the role of the unsaturated zone in contaminant transport processes. The unsaturated zone consists of thick layers of fractured basalts interbedded with thinner layers of sediment. These interbeds and basalts were deposited approximately 50,000 to 450,000 years ago during the late Pleistocene. As a part of a drilling program to develop a standard methodology for subsurface characterization and risk assessment at INEEL, hydraulic properties of the 34-m deep sedimentary interbed (known as the B-C interbed (Anderson and Lewis, 1989)) have been measured at one location in the vicinity of the SDA, including particle size distributions, water retention functions, saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, and related properties. In porous media, water flux is usually modeled in terms of Darcy's law for steady flow and Richards' equation for transient flow. Both of these formulations require knowledge of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K) of the media, a property that is difficult to measure and highly sensitive to variations in water content. The transient case additionally requires knowledge of the water retention relation, which similarly varies to a high degree within the medium. The interbeds may play several critical roles in long-range transport processes: (a) retardation of downward-moving water as it encounters layer boundaries, (b) generation of perched water, (c) homogenization of preferential flow that has been focused by basalt fractures, and (d) the formation of long-range, highly conductive horizontal flow paths for contaminants. Within these sedimentary layers, there may be little or no impediment to lateral flow. Drastic differences in hydraulic properties between the basalt and interbeds, and within the interbeds themselves, are likely to promote such flow.

## AndersonOthers1999

The effective hydraulic conductivity of basalt and interbedded sediment that compose the Snake River Plain aquifer at and near the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) ranges from about 1.0×10<sup>2</sup> to 3.2×10<sup>4</sup> feet per day (ft/d). This six-order-of-magnitude range of hydraulic conductivity was estimated from single-well aquifer tests in 114 wells, and is attributed mainly to the physical characteristics and distribution of basalt flows and dikes. Hydraulic conductivity is greatest in thin pahoehoe flows and near-vent volcanic deposits. Hydraulic conductivity is least in flows and deposits cut by dikes. Estimates of hydraulic conductivity at and near the INEEL are similar to those measured in similar volcanic settings in Hawaii.

The largest variety of rock types and the greatest range of hydraulic conductivity are in volcanic rift zones, which are characterized by numerous aligned volcanic vents and fissures related to underlying dikes. Volcanic features related to individual dike systems within these rift zones are approximated in the subsurface by narrow zones referred to as vent corridors. Vent corridors at and near the INEEL are generally perpendicular to ground-water flow and average about 1 to 2 miles in width and 5 to 15 miles in length. Forty-five vent corridors are inferred to be beneath the INEEL and adjacent areas. Vent corridors are characterized locally by anoxic water and altered basalt. In many of the vent corridors, water from the uppermost 200 feet of the aquifer is 1 to 7 degrees Celsius warmer than the median temperature of water (13 degrees Celsius) throughout the aquifer.

Three broad categories of hydraulic conductivity corresponding to six general types of geologic controls can be inferred from the distribution of wells and vent corridors. Hydraulic conductivity of category 1 includes 73 estimates, ranges from 1.0×10<sup>2</sup> to 3.2×10<sup>4</sup> ft/d, and corresponds to (1) the contacts, rubble zones, and cooling fractures of thin, tube-fed pahoehoe flows; and (2) the numerous voids present in shelly pahoehoe and slab pahoehoe flows; and bedded scoria, spatter, and ash near volcanic vents. Hydraulic conductivity of category 2 includes 28 estimates, ranges from 1.0×10<sup>0</sup> to 1.0×10<sup>2</sup> ft/d, and corresponds to (3) relatively thick, tube-fed pahoehoe flows that may be ponded in topographic depressions; and (4) thin, tube-fed pahoehoe flows cut by discontinuous dikes. Hydraulic conductivity of category 3 includes 13 estimates, ranges from 1.0×10<sup>-2</sup> to 1.0×10<sup>0</sup> ft/d, and corresponds to (5) localized dike swarms; and (6) thick, tube-fed pahoehoe flows cut by discontinuous dikes. Some overlap between these categories and controls is likely because of the small number of hydraulic conductivity estimates and the complex geologic environment.

Hydraulic conductivity of basalt flows probably is increased by localized fissures and coarse mixtures of interbedded sediment, scoria, and basalt rubble. Hydraulic conductivity of basalt flows is decreased locally by abundant alteration minerals of probable hydrothermal origin. Hydraulic conductivity varies as much as six orders of magnitude in a single vent corridor and varies from three to five orders of magnitude within distances of 500 to 1,000 feet. Abrupt changes in hydraulic conductivity over short distances suggest the presence of preferential pathways and local barriers that may greatly affect the movement of ground water and the dispersion of radioactive and chemical wastes downgradient from points of waste disposal.

The U.S. Geological Survey and the Idaho Department of Water Resources, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, sampled 18 sites as part of the fourth round of a long-term project to monitor water quality of the Snake River Plain aquifer from the southern boundary of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory to the Hagerman area. The samples were analyzed for selected radiochemical and chemical constituents. The samples were collected from 2 domestic wells, 12 irrigation wells, 2 stock wells, 1 spring, and 1 public supply well. Two quality-assurance samples also were collected and analyzed.

None of the reported radiochemical or chemical constituent concentrations exceeded the established maximum contaminant levels for drinking water. Many of the radionuclide- and inorganic-constituent concentrations were greater than the respective reporting levels. Most of the organic-constituent concentrations were less than the reporting levels.

Measurements of chlorine-36 (<sup>36</sup>Cl) were made for 64 water, snow, and glacial-ice and -runoff samples to determine the meteoric and weapons-tests-produced concentrations and fluxes of this radionuclide at mid-latitudes in North America. The results will facilitate the use of <sup>36</sup>Cl as a hydrogeologic tracer at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). This information was used to estimate meteoric and weapons-tests contributions of this nuclide to environmental inventories at and near the INEEL. Eighteen surface-water samples from six sites were selected from the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) archive-sample library at the INEEL for <sup>36</sup>Cl analyses. These 18 samples had been collected during 1969-94; <sup>36</sup>Cl concentrations ranged from 0.2±0.02×10<sup>8</sup> to2.2±0.05×10<sup>8</sup> atoms/liter (atoms/L). In 1994-95, an additional 14 surface-water and 2 spring samples from the eastern Snake River Plain were collected and analyzed for <sup>36</sup>Cl; <sup>36</sup>Cl concentrations ranged from 0.014±0.001×10<sup>8</sup> to 6.2±0.7×10<sup>8</sup> atoms/L, a range similar to the range of concentrations in the 18 archived samples. For comparison, <sup>36</sup>Cl concentrations in water from two monitoring wells at the INEEL were as large as 0.06±0.003×10<sup>8</sup> atoms/L for the well (Site 14) not affected by site waste disposal and 19,000±914×10<sup>8</sup> atoms/L for the well (USGS 77) about 500 meters (m) hydraulically downgradient from the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC).

Four snow samples were collected in 1991 at and near the INEEL to aid in establishing meteoric concentrations. The detectable <sup>36</sup>Cl concentrations in the snow samples ranged nearly four orders of magnitude, from 6.3±0.9×10<sup>6</sup> atoms/L at Harriman State Park, 150 kilometers (km) northeast of the INEEL, to 1.7±0.3×10<sup>10</sup> atoms/L near the INTEC. The estimated <sup>36</sup>Cl flux for a sample collected in Harriman State Park was 1.2±0.2×10<sup>2</sup> atoms/square centimeter/second (atoms/cm<sup>2</sup> sec). The estimated <sup>36</sup>Cl flux for a sample collected in Copper Basin, 75 km west of the INEEL, was 3±2×10<sup>3</sup> atoms/cm<sup>2</sup> sec. For comparison, 2 snow samples were collected at the INEEL downwind from the INTEC during nuclear-waste calcining operations. The estimated <sup>36</sup>Cl flux for the sample collected 11 km southwest of the effluent stack at the INTEC was 1.0+0.03 atoms/cm<sup>2</sup> sec and for the sample 1.5 km downwind, the flux was 12.0±2.4 atoms/cm<sup>2</sup> sec.

A 160-m ice core was collected in 1991 from the Upper Fremont Glacier in the Wind River Range of Wyoming in the western United States. In 1994-95, ice from this core was processed at the National Ice Core Laboratory in Denver, Colorado, and analyzed for <sup>36</sup>Cl. A tritium weapons-tests peak identified in the ice core was used as a marker to estimate the depth of weapons-tests produced <sup>36</sup>Cl. Tritium concentrations ranged from 0 tritium units for older ice to more than 360 tritium units at 29 m below the surface of the glacier, a depth that includes ice that was deposited as snow during nuclear-weapons tests through the early 1960's. Maximum <sup>36</sup>Cl production during nuclear-weapons tests was in the late 1950's; therefore, analyses were performed on ice samples from depths of 29.8 to 35.3 m. The peak <sup>36</sup>Cl concentration in these samples was 7.7±0.2×10<sup>7</sup> atoms/L at a depth of about 32 m. Estimated flux for <sup>36</sup>Cl in ice deposited as snow in the 1950's ranged from 9.0+0.2×10<sup>2</sup> atoms/cm<sup>2</sup> sec for an ice sample from 34.2 to 34.8 m to 2.9±0.1×10<sup>1</sup> atoms/cm<sup>2</sup> sec for an ice sample from 31.5 to 32.0 m; a mean global natural-production flux for <sup>36</sup>Cl of 1.1×10<sup>3</sup> atoms/cm<sup>2</sup> sec has been reported. The peak <sup>36</sup>Cl flux calculated in the present study was two orders of magnitude larger than the mean global natural-production flux and was similar to the weapons-tests flux of 5×10<sup>1</sup> atoms/cm<sup>2</sup> sec reported for the Dye 3 ice core from Greenland which was deposited during the same period of time as the Upper Fremont Glacier ice.

Ice samples from depths of 19.6 to 25.0 m, 39.6 to 46.4 m, and 104.7 to 106.3 m were selected to represent pre- and post-weapons-tests <sup>36</sup>Cl concentrations and fluxes. The <sup>36</sup>Cl concentrations in the pre- and post-weapons sections of glacial ice and runoff were less than 2×10<sup>7</sup> atoms/L. The estimated fluxes from these cores ranged from 4.5±0.7×10<sup>-3</sup> atoms/cm<sup>2</sup> sec to 6.3±0.3×10<sup>-2</sup> atoms/cm<sup>2</sup> sec. For comparison, a glacial-runoff sample collected in 1995 at Galena Creek Rock Glacier, 180 km north of the Upper Fremont Glacier, had an estimated concentration of 3.2+0.5×10<sup>6</sup> atoms/L and an estimated flux of 1.6±0.2×10<sup>2</sup> atoms/cm<sup>2</sup> sec.

The data presented in this report suggest a meteoric source of <sup>36</sup>Cl for environmental samples collected in southeastern Idaho and western Wyoming if the concentration is less than 1×10<sup>7</sup> atoms/L. Additionally, concentrations in water, snow, or glacial ice between 1×10<sup>7</sup> and 1×10<sup>8</sup> atoms/L may be indicative of a weapons-tests component from peak <sup>36</sup>Cl production in the late 1950s. Chlorine-36 concentrations between 1×10<sup>8</sup> and 1×10<sup>9</sup> atoms/L may be representative of re-suspension of weapons-tests fallout, airborne disposal of <sup>36</sup>Cl from the INTEC, or evapotranspiration.

It was concluded from the water, snow, and glacial data presented here that concentrations of <sup>36</sup>Cl measured in environmental samples at the INEEL larger than 1×10<sup>9</sup> atoms/L can be attributed to waste-disposal practices.

The U.S. Geological Survey, in response to a request from the U.S. Department of Energy's Pittsburgh Naval Reactors Office, Idaho Branch Office, sampled water from 13 wells during 1996 as part of a long-term project to monitor water quality of the Snake River Plain aquifer in the vicinity of the Naval Reactors Facility, Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, Idaho. Water samples were analyzed for naturally occurring constituents and man-made contaminants. A total of 51 samples were collected from the 13 monitoring wells. Seven quality-assurance samples also were collected and analyzed; one was a field-blank sample, one was a spiked organic sample, one was an organic trip-blank sample, and four were replicate samples. The field-blank sample contained concentrations of two inorganic constituents, one organic constituent, total organic carbon, and six radioactive constituents that were greater than the reporting levels. Concentrations of other constituents in the field-blank sample and those in the organic trip-blank sample were less than their respective reporting levels. The 4 replicate samples and their respective primary samples generated 517 pairs of analytical results for a variety of chemical and radiochemical constituents. Of the 517 data pairs, 493 were statistically equivalent at the 95-percent confidence level; about 95 percent of the analytical results were in agreement.

The characterization of waste-disposal sites requires knowledge of unsaturated flow, normally obtained using formulations based on Darcy's law or Richards' equation, for which two hydraulic properties of the porous media, the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, and the soil-water retention relation, must be determined. The extensive modification of the shallow subsurface at a waste-burial site can alter these properties and hence the unsaturated hydrology. These properties and their alteration should be accounted for in planning and constructing a waste facility. Our study assesses, through comparison with actual flow behavior, (1) the value of several types of standard unsaturated hydraulic property measurements for characterizing a waste-disposal site at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory and (2) the effect of landfill-construction disturbance on unsaturated-zone flow at this site. The site has a simulated waste trench constructed by excavating and replacing the soil to a depth of several meters. We measured hydraulic and other properties of the unsaturated medium by various techniques, including laboratory measurements on bulk soil and on minimally disrupted core samples, and field experiments. Among these techniques are higliT resolution water-retention measurements capable of showing minor structural differences with submersible pressure outflow cells, and a field instantaneous profile experiment involving 24 hours of flood infiltration followed by redistribution. We performed measurements by identical procedures on the simulated waste trench and on nearby undisturbed soil. The laboratory and field methods have considerable overlap in terms of the properties measured, especially the unsaturated hydraulic properties. The field methods include direct observation of changing conditions within the unsaturated zone, thus providing information about the behavior of water flow in addition to the property measurements.

The results permit comparisons in at least three ways: measured soil properties of undisturbed versus waste-trench soil, laboratory versus field measurement of properties, and measured properties versus observed flow behavior. The general character of the hydraulic properties is similar between the undisturbed and waste-trench soil. There are tendencies in the slopes of hydraulic conductivity and water retention curves that are consistent with a reduction in breadth of the pore-size distribution caused by waste-trench construction. Property measurements from the laboratory substantially agree with those from the field. The observed flow behavior in the unsaturated zone shows marked differences in the undisturbed versus waste-trench soil that are not predicted from the property measurements by means of a one-dimensional Richards' equation model. Richards' equation is a better approximation in the disturbed rather than in the undisturbed medium. Layering and preferential flow are both major influences in the undisturbed medium, and are much less significant in the simulated waste trench. In the waste trench as opposed to the undisturbed soil, initial infiltration is slower, but the lack of significant layering permits water to move more freely to depths below the zone of evapotranspiration. Although laboratory and field methods gave consistent hydraulic properties, the hydrologic phenomena of main interest required direct observation of water flow in the field.

Perched ground-water zones have formed in the upper 200 feet of surficial alluvium, basalt, and sedimentary interbeds beneath wastewater infiltration ponds at the Test Reactor Area (TRA) of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). These zones are an integral part of the pathway for contaminants to move to the Snake River Plain aquifer. Water moves rapidly through surficial sediments beneath the waste-water infiltration ponds as primarily vertical, unsaturated and saturated, intergranular flow. The extent of perched ground water in the surficial sediments is limited to the vicinity of infiltration ponds. Water enters underlying basalt through fractures and interflow rubble zones and moves rapidly through the basalt as vertical flow in the fractures and as lateral flow in the rubble zones. Water enters the sedimentary interbeds from the overlying basalt and moves as saturated and unsaturated intergranular flow. When the downward flux exceeds the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the interbeds, perched ground-water zones form and water moves laterally within and above the interbed unit. Vertical flow of water through the interbed unit enters the underlying basalts through fractures and moves as rapid fracture flow to the Snake River Plain aquifer.

The approximate lateral dimensions of deep perched ground-water zones in 1988 as defined by monitoring wells were 1 mile by 0.5 mile for an area of about 14 million square feet. The actual extent can only be approximated because of limited well information. This extent is controlled by the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the unit in which perched water accumulates, by the rate at which downward flow is propagated through the perching layer, and by structural features that can direct or block lateral flow.

Perched water has been detected in the BC and DEI basalt-flow groups and in a sedimentary interbed unit associated with the DE2, DE3, and DE3-4(W) flow groups. Water-level data from paired wells in some areas indicated that multiple zones of perched water were separated by unsaturated basalt. Water-level data from paired wells in other areas indicated that saturated flow was relatively continuous through the perched zones.

A four-layer numerical model was used to evaluate perched ground-water flow through the basalts and sediments in the upper 200 feet of the unsaturated zone beneath the TRA. This model treated perched flow as saturated flow and did not represent unsaturated flow properties related to changing moisture content. The first layer represented surficial sediments. The second and third layers represented basalt-flow groups designated as the BC and DEI flow groups, respectively. The fourth layer represented the sedimentary interbeds associated with the DE2, DE3, and DE3-4(W) basalt-flow groups and designated as the interbed unit. Calibrated hydraulic conductivity values of 20 and 2 feet per day were uniformly assigned to cells in layers 2 and 3, respectively. Calibrated values of hydraulic conductivity of 0.05 feet per day and vertical hydraulic conductivity of 0.0028 feet per day were assigned to cells in layer 4 to represent fine-grained sediment in the interbed unit. An effective porosity of 10 percent was assigned to all layers, and a confined storage coefficient of 0.0001, derived from the transient model calibration, was assigned to layers 2 through 4.

Until 1982, the extent of perched ground-water zones was controlled principally by wastewater infiltration from the warm-waste ponds. In 1982, with the onset of wastewater disposal to the cold-waste ponds, perched ground water expanded to the south and water levels in deeper perched wells rose substantially. The simulated extent of perched ground-water zones approximated the known extent as determined from water levels in wells near the margins of perched ground-water zones. Comparison between simulated water levels and measured water levels showed that layer 2 poorly to moderately represented these transient hydrologic conditions in the BC flow group because of insufficient definition of the distribution of hydraulic properties. Layer 3 moderately to closely represented transient conditions in the DEI flow group. The capability of layer 4 to represent transient conditions in the interbed unit was difficult to assess because most of the wells completed in the interbed were located at or outside the margins of perched water.

A simulation was run that assumed cessation of all wastewater recharge after 1994. This simulation showed that the perched ground-water zones drained approximately 4 years after cessation of recharge. All cells in layer 2 drained after approximately 6 months. All cells in layer 3 drained approximately 3.5 years after cessation. All cells in layer 4 drained approximately 4 years after cessation. The results of this transient simulation indicate that the BC and DEI flow groups and the interbed unit will drain quickly in response to cessation of recharge from the TRA wastewater infiltration ponds.

Measured water levels in several wells completed in the perched zones were affected by leakage from intermittent streamflow exceeding 20,000 acre-ft per month. Because short-term streamflow infiltration fluctuations were not well approximated, simulated recharge peaks did not occur in cells representing wells known to be affected by streamflow infiltration. More precise simulation of the periodic commingling of perched ground-water zones underlying the TRA and recharge from the Big Lost River requires finer discretization of time and recharge from streamflow.

The U.S. Geological Survey and Idaho State University, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, are conducting a study to determine and evaluate strontium distribution coefficients (K<sub>d</sub>s) of subsurface materials at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). The purpose of this study is to aid in assessing the variability of strontium K<sub>d</sub>s at the INEEL as part of an ongoing investigation of chemical transport of strontium-90 in the Snake River Plain aquifer. Batch experimental techniques were used to determine K<sub>d</sub>s of six basalt core samples, five samples of sediment infill of vesicles and fractures, and six standard material samples. The basalt and sediment infill samples were collected from a selected site at the INEEL. Batch experimental techniques were used to determine strontium K<sub>d</sub>s of the samples by using synthesized aqueous solutions representative of wastewater in disposal ponds at the INEEL. Calculated strontium K<sub>d</sub>s of the sediment infill samples ranged from 201.6110.8 to 356.2±8.4 milliliters per gram (mL/g). Calculated strontium K<sub>d</sub>s of the basalt samples ranged from 1.3±8.4 to 9.3±9.8 mL/g. The differences in strontium K<sub>d</sub>s arise from the variations in chemical composition and preparation of samples. The sorption process that occurs, physisorption or ion exchange, depends largely on the type of the sample material. Analyses of data from these experiments indicate that the K<sub>d</sub>s of the sediment infill samples are significantly larger than those of the basalt samples. Quantification of such information is essential for furthering the understanding of transport processes of strontium-90 in the Snake River Plain aquifer and in similar environments.

The U.S. Geological Survey and Idaho State University, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, conducted a study to determine strontium distribution coefficients (K<sub>d</sub>s) of surficial sediments at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). Batch experimental techniques were used to determine experimental K<sub>d</sub>s of 20 surficial-sediment samples from the INEEL. The K<sub>d</sub>s describe the distribution of a solute between the solution and solid phase. K<sub>d</sub>s of the 20 surficial-sediment samples ranged from 36 to 275 milliliters per gram. Many chemical and physical properties of both the synthesized aqueous solution and sediments used in the experiments also were determined. The following solution properties were determined: initial and equilibrium concentrations of calcium, magnesium, and strontium; pH and specific conductance; and initial concentrations of potassium and sodium. Sediment properties determined were grain-size distribution, mineralogy, whole-rock major oxide, strontium and barium concentrations, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area. Multivariate-regression techniques were used to identify which of these variables or set of variables could best predict the strontium K<sub>d</sub> values. Partial least-squares regression was used to fit these data to an empirical model that could be used to predict strontium K<sub>d</sub>s of surficial sediments at the INEEL. The best-fit model was obtained using a four-variable data set consisting of surface area, manganese oxide concentration, specific conductance, and pH. Application of the model to an independent split of the data resulted in an average relative error of prediction of 20 percent and a correlation coefficient of 0.921 between predicted and observed strontium K<sub>d</sub>s. Chemical and physical characteristics of the solution and sediment that could successfully predict the K<sub>d</sub> values were identified. Prediction variable selection was limited to variables which are either easily determined or have available tabulated characteristics. The selection criterion could circumvent the need for time- and labor-intensive laboratory experiments and provide an alternate faster method for estimating strontium K<sub>d</sub>s.

Radiochemical and chemical wastes generated at facilities at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) have been discharged to infiltration ponds at the Test Reactor Area (TRA) and the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP) and buried at the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC) since 1952. Disposal of waste-water to ponds and infiltration of surface water at waste-burial sites have resulted in formation of perched ground water hi basalts and in sedimentary interbeds above the Snake River Plain aquifer. Perched ground water is an integral part of the pathway for waste-constituent migration to the aquifer.

The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, maintains a continuous monitoring network at the INEL to determine hydrologic trends and to monitor the movement of wastewater discharged from facilities. This report presents an analysis of water-level and water-quality data collected from perched ground water at the INEL during 1992-95.

During 1992-95, tritium concentrations in water from wells completed in deep perched ground water at the TRA generally decreased or were variable. During July-October 1995, concentrations ranged from less than the reporting level to 158±5 picocuries per milliliter (pCi/mL). The maximum tritium concentration in the shallow perched ground water at the TRA during 1992-95 was 3,940±60 pCi/mL in January 1992. By October 1995, the tritium concentration in water from the same well had decreased to 22.4±0.9 pCi/mL. Tritium concentrations in water from wells at the TRA were affected by distance of the well from the radioactive-waste ponds, depth of the water below the ponds, monthly variations in the amount of tritium discharged, discontinued use of the radioactive-waste ponds, radioactive decay, and dilution from nonradioactive water.

During 1992-95, strontium-90 concentrations in water from wells completed in deep perched ground water at the TRA were variable. During October 1995, concentrations were from 6.4±0.9 to 143±5 pCi/L. Cesium-137, chromium-51, and cobalt-60 all were detected in water from a shallow well near the leaky radioactive-waste pond retention basin.

Dissolved chromium concentrations in perched ground water at the TRA during 1995 were from less than 5 to 590 micrograms per liter. The largest concentrations were in water from wells north and west of the radioactive-waste ponds. Dissolved sodium concentrations were from 7.1 to 1,200 milligrams per liter (mg/L) in 1995. Dissolved sulfate concentrations were from 18 to 3,900 mg/L. The largest concentrations of sodium and sulfate were in water from a well near the chemical-waste pond.

During 1992-95, tritium concentrations in water from wells completed in deep perched ground water near the ICPP infiltration ponds generally decreased because of decreased disposal; strontium-90 concentrations were variable. In October 1995, tritium concentrations ranged from less than the reporting level to 1.0±0.2 pCi/mL; strontium-90 concentrations were below the reporting level in all wells.

During 1992-95, concentrations of sodium, chloride, sulfate, and nitrate in water from wells completed in perched ground water near the ICPP infiltration ponds were similar to the concentrations of the constituents in the wastewater discharged.

During 1992-94, concentrations of americium-241 and plutonium-238 were above the reporting level in one sample each from a well completed in perched ground water at the RWMC. Other radionuclides had concentrations below the reporting levels.

Radiochemical and chemical constituents in wastewater generated at facilities of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) (figure 1) have been discharged to waste-disposal ponds and wells since the early 1950 s. Public concern has been expressed that some of these constituents could migrate through the Snake River Plain aquifer to the Snake River in the Twin Falls-Hagerman area Because of these concerns the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) requested that the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) conduct three studies to gain a greater understanding of the chemical quality of water in the aquifer. One study described a one-time sampling effort for radionuclides, trace elements, and organic compounds in the eastern part of the A&B Irrigation District in Minidoka County (Mann and Knobel, 1990). Another ongoing study involves sampling for tritium from 19 springs on the north side of the Snake River in the Twin Falls-Hagerman area (Mann, 1989; Mann and Low, 1994). A third study an ongoing annual sampling effort in the area between the southern boundary of the INEEL and Hagerman (figure 1) (hereafter referred to as the Magic Valley study area), is being conducted with the Idaho Department of Water Resources in cooperation with the DOE. Data for a variety of radiochemical and chemical constituents from this study have been published by Wegner and Campbell (1991); Bartholomay, Edwards, and Campbell (1992, 1993, 1994a, 1994b); and Bartholomay, Williams, and Campbell (1995, 1996, 1997b). Data discussed in this fact sheet were taken from these reports. An evaluation of data collected during the first four years of this study (Bartholomay Williams, and Campbell, 1997a) showed no pattern of water-quality change for radionuclide data as concentrations randomly increased or decreased. The inorganic constituent data showed no statistical change between sample rounds.

The U.S. Geological Survey and the Idaho Department of Water Resources, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, sampled 18 sites as part of the fourth round of a long-term project to monitor water quality of the Snake River Plain aquifer from the southern boundary of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory to the Hagerman area. Water samples were collected and analyzed for selected radiochemical and chemical constituents. The samples were collected from seven domestic wells, six irrigation wells, two springs, one dairy well, one observation well, and one stock well. Two quality-assurance samples also were collected and analyzed.

None of the radiochemical or chemical constituents exceeded the established maximum contaminant levels for drinking water. Many of the radionuclide- and inorganic-constituent concentrations were greater than their respective reporting levels.

The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) is located on the eastern Snake River Plain in southeastern Idaho; it is a multipurpose complex operated by the U.S. Department of Energy. Among its installations is the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP), a facility designed principally to recover highly enriched uranium (≥93% <sup>235</sup>U) from different nuclear fuel types used in naval propulsion, research, and test reactors. Starting in 1952 and continuing until 1984, low-level radioactive waste was discharged from the ICPP directly to the Snake River Plain aquifer by means of an injection well and seepage ponds. Over time, a suite of radionuclides have been measured in the aquifer including <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>36</sup>Cl, <sup>90</sup>Sr, <sup>137</sup>Cs, <sup>129</sup>I, and Pu isotopes. Reported here are the first measurements of the long-lived radionuclides <sup>99</sup>Tc, <sup>236</sup>U, and <sup>237</sup>Np in the aquifer and their downgradient concentration changes during water transport through fractured basalt. Like <sup>36</sup>Cl, <sup>99</sup>Tc behaves conservatively during transport while <sup>129</sup>I, <sup>236</sup>U, and <sup>237</sup>Np indicate retardation.

Delineation of areas at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory that would be inundated by a 100-year peak flow in the Big Lost River is needed by the U.S. Department of Energy to fulfill flood-plain regulatory requirements. The Big Lost River flows southeastward about 50 miles through an alluvium-filled valley onto the eastern Snake River Plain. The 35-mile downstream reach of the Big Lost River that flows across the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory and ends in a series of playas is of particular concern. Many anthropogenic features in the study area affect flood hydraulics and flow.

Thirty-seven channel cross sections were surveyed to develop and apply a one-dimensional hydraulic model to calculate water-surface elevations and estimate the areas of inundation for the 100-year peak flow in the Big Lost River. From the western boundary of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory to the diversion dam, a peak flow of 7,260 cubic feet per second was simulated. On the basis of a structural analysis, the diversion dam was assumed incapable of retaining high flows and, thus, was not included in model simulations. However, the diversion channel does affect flows downstream from the dam. Model results indicated that 6,220 cubic feet per second would flow down-stream from the dam in the Big Lost River if the dam did not exist, and the remainder would flow in the diversion channel. Where State Highway 26 crosses the Big Lost River, about 47 percent of the flow would pass under the bridge and the remainder would flow over the highway about 1,200 feet southeast of the bridge. The calculated water-surface elevation was about 1 foot higher than the highway. Where Lincoln Boulevard crosses the Big Lost River near the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant, the calculated water surface was about 0.4 foot higher than the road. About 24 percent of the flow would pass through the culverts, and the remainder would flow over the road. At the railroad bridge near the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant, the calculated water surface averaged 0.5 foot higher than the railroad. About 40 percent of the flow would pass under the bridge, and the remainder would flow over the railroad. Model results also indicated that 30 percent of the total flow would pass under the bridge at Lincoln Boulevard near the Naval Reactors Facility, and the remainder would flow over the road.

The 100-year peak flow boundary at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory was defined. The flood plain was as narrow as 120 feet near the western boundary of the study area and as wide as 1.2 miles near the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant. The northern part of the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant and its entrance road would be the only facility that would be flooded. The experimental dairy farm about 2.5 miles downstream from the plant also would be flooded.

Discretion must be exercised in the use of these model results. The simplifying assumptions used in this and other one-dimensional models and the limited number of cross sections used prevent precise simulation of the flood hazard. The model gives a reasonable determination of the water-surface elevations and the inundated areas for the 100-year peak flow. However, these one-dimensional model results are preliminary and primarily intended to provide guidance in the construction of a more stringent flow model. Application of more stringent models (two dimensional) is needed to refine and better delineate the extent of possible flooding of the Big Lost River at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory.

From July 1994 through May 1997, the U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with the Department of Energy, sampled 86 wells completed in the Snake River Plain aquifer at and near the Idaho N ationa1 Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). The wells were sampled for a variety of constituents including one-and two-carbon halocarbons. Concentrations of dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC-12), trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) and trichlorotrifluororoethane (CFC-113) were determined. The samples for halocarbon analysis were collected in 62-milliliter flame sealed borosilicate glass ampoules in the field. The data will be used to evaluate the ages of ground waters at INEEL. The ages of the ground water will be used to determine recharge rates, residence time, and travel time of water in the Snake River Plain aquifer in and near INEEL. The chromatograms of 139 ground waters are presented showing a large number of halomethanes, haloethanes, and haloethenes present in the ground waters underlying the INEEL. The chromatograms can be used to qualitatively evaluate a large number of contaminants at parts per trillion to parts per billion concentrations. The data can be used to study temporal and spatial distribution of contaminants in the Snake River Plain aquifer. Representative compressed chromatograms for all ground waters sampled in this study are available on two 3.5-inch high density computer disks. The data and the program required to decompress the data can be obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey office at Idaho Falls, Idaho. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>) concentrations were measured in selected wells to determine the feasibility of using this environmental tracer as an age dating tool of ground water. Concentrations of dissolved nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and methane were measured in 79 ground waters. Concentrations of dissolved permanent gases are tabulated and will be used to evaluate the temperature of recharge of ground water in and near the INEEL.

Since 1966, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) routinely has archived at least one suite of quarterly ground- and surface-water samples collected at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) each year. The samples and a large associated database are available for research purposes. To evaluate the suitability of the samples as an indicator of historical radionuclide concentrations, archived-water samples collected from six USGS monitoring wells from 1966-93 and one surface-water site for 1970 were analyzed for stable chlorine isotopic ratios, chlorine-37/chlorine-35 (<sup>37</sup>Cl/<sup>35</sup>Cl). These ratios may be useful in determining if fractionation of chlorine isotopes has occurred during storage or if mixing has occurred along a flowpath in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer at the INEEL. This information is useful in evaluating if radioactive chlorine (<sup>36</sup>Cl) concentrations measured in water from the archive samples in the 1990's are representative of the historical concentration at the time of sample collection.

The <sup>37</sup>Cl/<sup>35</sup>Cl ratio of the archived samples was measured at the Environmental Isotope Laboratory at the University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, and was compared to the <sup>37</sup>Cl/<sup>35</sup>Cl of Standard Mean Ocean Chloride. The resultant delta <sup>37</sup>Cl (δ<sup>37</sup>Cl) ranged from -0.44 to +0.59 permil. The largest variation in δ<sup>37</sup>Cl for water from any individual well was 0.91 permil. The small range of positive δ<sup>37</sup>Cl values are indicative of an environmental setting having little or no measurable fractionation of stable chlorine isotopes. Negative δ<sup>37</sup>Cl values were attributed to wastewater disposed at the INEEL and not to any processes operational during sample storage in the archive library or along the flowpath in the Snake River Plain aquifer.

Chlorine-36 concentrations also were measured in the archive ground-water samples selected for this evaluation. The historical <sup>36</sup>Cl concentrations ranged from 1.1±0.1×10<sup>8</sup> atoms/liter to 28,000±910×10<sup>8</sup> atoms/liter. Based on the evaluation of the archived-water samples in terms of δ<sup>37</sup>Cl, it was concluded that the <sup>36</sup>Cl concentrations measured in 1993 were representative of the concentrations at the time of sample collection.

Meltwater runoff from glaciers can result from various sources, including recent precipitation and melted glacial ice. Determining the origin of the meltwater from glaciers through isotopic analysis can provide information about such things as the character and distribution of ablation on glaciers.

A 9.4 m ice core and meltwater were collected in 1995 and 1996 at the glacigenic Galena Creek rock glacier in Wyoming's Absaroka Mountains. Measurements of chlorine‐36 (<sup>36</sup>Cl), tritium (<sup>3</sup>H), sulphur‐35 (<sup>35</sup>S), and delta oxygen‐18 (δ<sup>18</sup>O) were compared to similar measurements from an ice core taken from the Upper Fremont Glacier in the Wind River Range of Wyoming collected in 1991–95. Meltwater samples from three sites on the rock glacier yielded <sup>36</sup>Cl concentrations that ranged from 2.1±1.0×10<sup>6</sup> to 5.8±0.3×10<sup>6</sup> atoms/l. The ice‐core <sup>36</sup>Cl concentrations from Galena Creek ranged from 3.4±0.3×10<sup>5</sup> to 1.0±0.1×10<sup>6</sup> atoms/l. Analysis of an ice core from the Upper Fremont Glacier yielded <sup>36</sup>Cl concentrations of 1.2±0.2×10<sup>6</sup> and 5.2±0.2×10<sup>6</sup> atoms/l for pre‐1940 ice and between 2 ×106 and 3×106 atoms/l for post‐1980 ice. Purdue's PRIME Lab analyzed the ice from the Upper Fremont Glacier. The highest concentration of <sup>36</sup>Cl in the ice was 77±2×10<sup>6</sup> atoms/l and was deposited during the peak of atmospheric nuclear weapons testing in the late 1950s. This is an order of magnitude greater than the largest measured concentration from both the Upper Fremont Glacier ice core that was not affected by weapons testing fallout and the ice core collected from the Galena Creek rock glacier.

Tritium concentrations from the rock glacier ranged from 9.2±0.6 to 13.2±0.8 tritium units (TU) in the meltwater to −1.3±1.3 TU in the ice core. Concentrations of 3H in the Upper Fremont Glacier ice core ranged from 0 TU in the ice older than 50 years to 6–12 TU in the ice deposited in the last 10 years. The maximum 3H concentration in ice from the Upper Fremont Glacier deposited in the early 1960s during peak weapons testing fallout for this isotope was 360 TU.

One meltwater sample from the rock glacier was analyzed for <sup>35</sup>S with a measured concentration of 5.4±1.0 millibecquerel per liter (mBeq/l). Modern precipitation in the Rocky Mountains contains <sup>35</sup>S from 10 to 40 mBeq/L. The δ<sup>18</sup>O results in meltwater from the Galena Creek rock glacier (−17.40±0.1 to −17.98±0.1 per mil) are similar to results for modern precipitation in the Rocky Mountains. Comparison of these isotopic concentrations from the two glaciers suggest that the meltwater at the Galena Creek site is composed mostly of melted snow and rain that percolates through the rock debris that covers the glacier. Additionally, this water from the rock debris is much younger (less than two years) than the reported age of about 2000 years for the subsurface ice at the mid‐glacier coring site. Thus the meltwater from the Galena Creek rock glacier is composed primarily of melted surface snow and rain water rather than melted glacier ice, supporting previous estimates of slow ablation rates beneath the surface debris of the rock glacier.

Strontium distribution coefficients (K<sub>d</sub>'s) were measured for 24 basalt core samples collected from selected sites at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). The measurements were made to help assess the variability of strontium K<sub>d</sub>'s as part of an ongoing investigation of strontium transport properties through geologic materials at the INEEL. The investigation is being conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey and Idaho State University in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy. Batch experiments were used to measure K<sub>d</sub>'s of basalt core samples using an aqueous solution representative of wastewater in waste-disposal ponds at the INEEL. Calculated strontium K<sub>d</sub>'s of the 24 basalt core samples ranged from 3.6±1.3 to 29.4±1.6 milliliters per gram. These results indicate a narrow range of variability in the strontium sorptive capacities of basalt relative to those of the sedimentary materials at the INEEL. The narrow range of the basalt K<sub>d</sub>'s can be attributed to physical and chemical properties of the basalt, and to compositional changes in the equilibrated solutions after being mixed with the basalt. The small K<sub>d</sub>'s indicate that basalt is not a major contributor in preventing the movement of strontium-90 in solution.

Water samples from 54 wells and 6 surface-water sites at or near the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory were analyzed for 63 purgeable organic compounds during 1992-95. The samples were collected and analyzed as a continuation of water-quality studies initiated in 1987 and conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy. Water from 53 of the wells comes from the Snake River Plain aquifer. The remaining well was completed in a perched water zone above the Snake River Plain aquifer.

Water samples from 23 wells completed in the Snake River Plain aquifer contained detectable concentrations of at least 1 of 14 selected purgeable organic compounds. The most commonly detected compounds were carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, and trichloroethylene. The concentrations of most compounds were less than the laboratory reporting levels. The water sample from the perched zone contained detectable concentrations of 18 purgeable organic compounds.

The use of synthesized aqueous solutions for determining experimentally derived strontium sorption isotherms of sediment was investigated as part of a study accessing strontium chemical transport properties. Batch experimental techniques were used to determine strontium sorption isotherms using synthesized aqueous solutions designed to chemically represent water from a natural aquifer with respect to major ionic character and pH. A strontium sorption isotherm for a sediment derived using a synthesized aqueous solution was found to be most comparable to an isotherm derived using natural water when the synthesized aqueous solution contained similar concentrations of calcium and magnesium. However, it is difficult to match compositions exactly due to the effects of disequilibrium between the solution and the sediment. Strong linear relations between sorbed strontium and solution concentrations of calcium and magnesium confirm that these cations are important co-constituents in these synthesized aqueous solutions. Conversely, weak linear relations between sorbed strontium and solution concentrations of sodium and potassium indicate that these constituents do not affect sorption of strontium. The addition of silica to the synthesized aqueous solution does not appreciably affect the resulting strontium sorption isotherm.

Strontium distribution coefficients (K<sub>d</sub>'s) were measured for 21 surficial and 17 sedimentary interbed samples collected from sediment cores from selected sites at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) to help assess the variability of strontium K<sub>d</sub>s at the INEEL as part of an ongoing investigation of strontium chemical-transport properties. Batch experimental techniques were used to determine strontium K<sub>d</sub>'s of the sediments. Measured strontium K<sub>d</sub>'s of the surficial and interbedded sediments ranged from 26±1 to 328±41 milliliters per gram. These results indicate significant variability in the strontium sorptive capacities of surficial and interbedded sediments at the INEEL. Some of this variability can be attributed to physical and chemical properties of the sediment; other variability may be due to compositional changes in the equilibrated solutions after being mixed with the sediment.

Trenches and pits at the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC) Subsurface Disposal Area (SDA) at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (formerly known as the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory) have been used for burial of radioactive waste since 1952. In 1985, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, began a multi-phase study of the geohydrology of the RWMC to provide a basis for estimating the extent of and the potential for migration of radionuclides in the unsaturated zone beneath the waste trenches and pits. This phase of the study provides hydrologic and meteorological data collected at a designated test trench area adjacent to the northern boundary of the RWMC SDA from 1990 through 1996 (fig. 1). The test trench area was constructed by the USGS in 1985.

Hydrologic data presented in this report were collected during 1990-96 in the USGS test trench area. Soil-moisture content measurements from disturbed and undisturbed soil were collected approximately monthly during 1990-96 from 11 neutron-probe access holes with a neutron moisture gage. In 1994, three additional neutron access holes were completed for monitoring. A meteorological station inside the test trench area provided data for determination of evapotranspiration rates. This station measured soil surface temperature, net radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, vapor pressure, windspeed, wind direction, soil heat flux, and precipitation. Meteorological data for the test trench area are available for 1994 96.

The soil-moisture and meteorological data are contained in files on 3-1/2 inch diskettes (disks 1 and 2) included with this report. The data are presented in simple American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) format with tab-delimited fields. The files occupy a total of 1.5 megabytes of disk space.

Radioactive and chemical wastes generated at facilities at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) have been contained in wastewater discharged to infiltration ponds at the Test Reactor Area (TRA) and the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP) since 1952. Radioactive and chemical wastes also have been buried at the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC). Discharge of wastewater to ponds and infiltration of surface-water runoff at waste-burial sites have resulted in formation of perched ground water in basalts and sedimentary interbeds above the Snake River Plain aquifer. Perched ground water is an integral part of the pathway along which waste constituents migrate to the aquifer.

The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, maintains a continuous monitoring network at the INEL to determine hydrologic trends and to monitor the movement of wastewater discharged from facilities. This report presents an analysis of water-level and water-quality data collected from selected wells completed in perched ground water at the INEL during 1989-91.

About 470 curies (Ci) of tritium was discharged to the TRA warm-waste ponds during 1989-91. In 1991, concentrations of tritium greater than the reporting level in water from wells completed in deep perched ground water ranged from 1.3±0.2 to 785±12 picocuries per milliliter (pCi/mL). Variability in tritium concentrations in water from wells in perched ground water at the TRA during 1989-91 was related to variable tritium disposal rates, distance of the wells from the warm-waste ponds, and the depth to water below the ponds.

In April 1991, concentrations of strontium-90 in water from seven wells completed in the deep perched ground water were from 11±2 to 17±9 picocuries per liter (pCi/L). Variations in strontium-90 concentrations are attributed to chemical equilibrium between strontium-90 sorbed to sediments and strontium-90 in solution in shallow perched ground water.

In October 1991, dissolved chromium concentrations in deep perched ground water at the TRA were from 2 to 90 micrograms per liter (mg/L). The distribution of chromium indicates that perched ground water in outlying wells to the west and south of the TRA contained constituents that were discharged to the warm-waste ponds before 1965.

In October 1991, sodium concentrations in deep perched ground water at the TRA were from 10 to 1,300 milligrams per liter (mg/L). Sulfate concentrations in October 1990 were from 35 to 4,300 mg/L. Sulfate wasn't sampled for in 1991. The largest concentrations of sodium and sulfate during these years were in water from a well near the chemical-waste ponds. These large concentrations indicate that concentrations in perched ground water to the north and northwest of the TRA were dominated by wastewater discharged to the chemical-waste pond.

During 1989-91, tritium concentrations in perched ground water from wells near the infiltration ponds at the ICPP decreased because of a significant decrease in the disposal rate of tritium from earlier years. In October 1991, tritium concentrations in perched ground water from wells near the infiltration ponds ranged from less than a reporting level of 3 times the sample standard deviation to 32.3±0.8 pCi/mL.

In October 1991, strontium-90 concentrations in perched ground water near the ICPP infiltration ponds ranged from less than the reporting level to 13±2.0 pCi/L. Concentrations were largest in surficial sediments and decreased with distance from the ponds and with depth. Decreases are attributed to sorption of strontium-90 to surficial and interbed sediments.

During 1989-91, concentrations of chloride and sulfate in perched ground water from wells near the ICPP infiltration ponds were similar to the concentrations in the wastewater discharged to the ponds.

During 1989-91, no radiochemical constituents were above the reporting level in water samples from a well completed in perched ground water at the RWMC. One water sample collected from the well in January 1990 contained 230 mg/L of carbon tetrachloride, 300 mg/L of chloroform, 72 mg/L of trichloroethene, 37 mg/L of 1,1,1-trichloroethane, 5.6 mg/L of 1,1-dichloroethane, and 4.5 mg/L of tetrachloroethane.

The eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP) is a topographic and structural depression in southeastern Idaho which has been progressively filling with basaltic lava flows since at least ∼3.2 Ma. Accurate correlation of basalts in the subsurface of the ESRP are required to understand the magmatic and tectonic evolution of the region. Trace element variations within and between basalt flow groups at the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC) in the southern Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) were evaluated to refine a method of basalt correlation. The results suggest that correlation via trace element variation is viable and consistent with correlations made by other methods.

Three dimensional analysis of 16 subsurface basalt supergroups previously identified via natural-gamma logging at and near the INEEL suggests the presence of at least 35 flow groups. The flow morphologies of the supergroups represented by isopach and structural contour maps is interpreted to reflect the paleotopography present during emplacement of each stratigraphic unit, as well as the locations of eruptive centers within each unit. The secular variation of eruptive centers suggests the existence of linear volcanic trends which are interpreted to reflect the northwest to southeast propagation of strain, and also indicates that local volcanic hiatuses of 200 k.y. are not uncommon for the ESRP. Comparison of volumes of the latest Pleistocene to Holocene monogenetic lava fields of the ESRP with those identified within subsurface supergroups at and near the INEEL reveal a substantial discordance between the two. This suggests that the lava fields of the latest Pleistocene to Holocene are of insufficient number to represent the complete history of basaltic volcanism for the ESRP.

Strain and extensional rate calculations, based on the assumption that dike dilation is the mechanism by which the ESRP extends, are as much as an order of magnitude less than rates determined for the Basin and Range Province north of the plain, but slightly greater than those determined for the Basin and Range Province south of the plain.

A structural depression in the central portion of the INEEL is interpreted to exist by its paucity of eruptive centers (relative to the Arco-Big Southern Butte VRZ, and the axial volcanic zone) and the fact that distal portions of flow groups are at higher elevations greater than the elevations interpreted for the eruptive centers which produced them. The central INEEL is inferred to have subsided as much as 200 m relative to western portions of the Arco-Big Southern Butte VRZ. Structural contour maps do not support the interpretation that differential subsidence or uplift is the result of continued activity on the Lost River Fault below the surface of the ESRP. However, they may support the hypothesis that subsidence is the result of continued activity of ring-faults associate with a buried caldera (Blue Creek?).

The U.S. Geological (USGS) and the Idaho Department of Water Resources, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, collected and analyzed water samples to monitor the water quality of the Snake River Plain aquifer from the southern boundary of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory to the Hagerman area, Idaho. Concurrently, replicate samples and blank samples were collected and analyzed as part of the quality-assurance/quality-control program. Samples were analyzed from inorganic constituents, gross radioactivity and radionuclides, organic constituents, and stable isotopes.

To evaluate the precision of field and laboratory methods, analytical results of the water-quality and replicate samples were compared statistically for equivalence on the basis of the precision associated with each result. Statistical comparisons of the data indicated that 95 percent of the results of the replicate pairs were equivalent. Blank-sample analytical results indicated that the inorganic blank water and volatile organic compound blank water from the USGS National Water Quality Laboratory and the distilled water from the Idaho Department of Water Resources were suitable for blanks; blank water from other sources was not. Equipment-blank analytical results were evaluated to determine if a bias had been introduced and possible sources of bias. Most equipment blanks were analyzed for trace elements and volatile organic compounds; chloroform was found in one equipment blank. Two of the equipment blanks were prepared after collection and analyses of the water-quality samples to determine whether contamination had been introduced during the sampling process. Results of one blank indicated that a hose used to divert water away from pumps and electrical equipment had contaminated the samples with some volatile organic compounds. Results of the other equipment blank, from the apparatus used to filter dissolved organic carbon samples, indicated that the filtering apparatus did not affect water-quality samples.

The unsaturated zone and the Snake River Plain aquifer at and near the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) are made up of at least 178 basalt-flow groups, 103 sedimentary interbeds, 6 andesite-flow groups, and 4 rhyolite domes. Stratigraphic units identified in 333 wells in this 890-mile<sup>2</sup> area include 121 basalt-flow groups, 102 sedimentary interbeds, 6 andesite-flow groups, and 1 rhyolite dome. Stratigraphic units were identified and correlated using the data from numerous outcrops and 26 continuous cores and 328 natural-gamma logs available in December 1993. Basalt flows make up about 85 percent of the volume of deposits underlying the area.

Several types of data were used to identify and correlate Stratigraphic units. Basalt, sediment, andesite, and rhyolite were identified from outcrops and cores selectively evaluated for paleomagnetic inclination and polarity, potassium-argon and argon-argon geologic ages, petrographic characteristics, and major-oxide and trace-element chemical composition. Stratigraphic units were correlated using these data and natural-gamma logs, which respond to potassium contents of generally less than 1 percent in basalt to more than 4 percent in rhyolite. The best Stratigraphic correlations at and near the INEL were obtained for basalt and sediment at the Contained Test Facility (CTF), Test Area North (TAN), the Naval Reactors Area, the Test Reactor Area, the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant, the Central Facilities Area, and the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC), where most cores and two thirds of the logs were obtained. Correlations range from good for units at the RWMC to uncertain for units in the eastern half of the INEL.

Fourteen composite Stratigraphic units, each made up of 5 to 90 Stratigraphic units of similar age, are used to describe the stratigraphy of the unsaturated zone and aquifer. Upper and lower boundaries of each composite unit were selected to show the main Stratigraphic and structural features underlying the INEL and adjacent areas. Composite unit 1, the youngest unit, is made up of 78 basalt-flow groups and 12 sedimentary interbeds. Composite unit 14, the oldest unit, is made up of 4 basalt-flow groups and 1 sedimentary interbed. The decrease in the number of stratigraphic units assigned to each successively older composite unit is attributed partly to larger and less-frequent volcanic eruptions during the accumulation of these units and partly to the limited distribution of available cores used to identify stratigraphic units at greater depths in the subsurface. Composite units 1 through 7 generally range in age from about 200 to 800 thousand years and make up the unsaturated zone and the uppermost part of the Snake River Plain aquifer in most places. Composite units 8 through 14 range in age from about 800 thousand to 1.8 million years and make up the unsaturated zone and aquifer at and near the CTF and TAN and the lowermost part of the aquifer elsewhere. Water levels in the aquifer in 1996 coincided with composite units 4 and 5 in most places; water levels coincided with composite unit 12 at and near the CTF and TAN. Hydraulic gradients of the water table range from about 1 to 15 feet/mile, average about 4 feet/mile, and, in places, change abruptly near concealed uplifts in the aquifer. These abrupt changes indicate that dipping layers and increased sediment content of composite Stratigraphic units near uplifts may affect the movement of water and waste in the aquifer.

## AndersonOthers1997

Geologic ages and accumulation rates, estimated from regressions, were used to evaluate measured ages and interpreted stratigraphic and structural relations of basalt and sediment in the unsaturated zone and the Snake River Plain aquifer at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) in eastern Idaho. Geologic ages and accumulation rates were estimated from standard linear regressions of 21 mean potassium-argon (K-Ar) ages, selected mean paleomagnetic ages, and cumulative depths of a composite stratigraphic section composed of complete intervals of basalt and sediment that were deposited in areas of past maximum subsidence. Accumulation rates also were estimated from regressions of stratigraphic intervals in three wells in and adjacent to an area of interpreted uplift at and near the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP) and the Test Reactor Area (TRA) to allow a comparison of rates in areas of past uplift and subsidence.

Estimated geologic ages range from about 200 thousand to 1.8 million years before present and are reasonable approximations for the interval of basalt and sediment above the effective base of the aquifer, based on reported uncertainties of corresponding measured ages. Estimated ages between 200 and 800 thousand years are within the range of reported uncertainties for all 15 K-Ar ages used in regressions and two out of three argon-argon (<sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar) ages of duplicate samples. Two sets of estimated ages between 800 thousand and 1.8 million years are within the range of reported uncertainties for all seven K-Ar ages used in regressions, which include one shared age of about 800 thousand years. Two sets of ages were estimated for this interval because K-Ar ages make up two populations that agree with previous (1979) and revised (1995) ages of three paleomagnetic subchrons. The youngest set of ages is consistent with a K-Ar age from the effective base of the aquifer that agrees with previous (1979) ages of the Olduvai Normal-Polarity Subchron. The oldest set of ages is consistent with an <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar age of the same basalt flow that agrees with revised (1995) ages of the Olduvai Subchron. Regressions indicate that measured ages and stratigraphic interpretations are reasonable for basalt and sediment between the ages of 200 and 800 thousand years, the youngest deposits that could be evaluated using regressions. Regressions indicate potential errors in measured ages or stratigraphic interpretations for basalt and sediment between the ages of 800 thousand to 1.8 million years, the oldest deposits in the aquifer. Ages of older basalt flows in the aquifer are difficult to measure because many flows are altered. Stratigraphic relations of older basalt and sediment in the aquifer are difficult to determine because there are few cored intervals of this age.

Accumulation rates, estimated from regressions of stratigraphic intervals younger than 640 thousand years in three wells in and adjacent to an area of interpreted uplift at and near the ICPP and TRA, range from 59 to 282 feet/100,000 years and average 163 feet/100,000 years, a rate that is nearly identical to a previous (1994) estimate of the subsidence rate between the INEL and the Yellowstone Plateau during the past 4 million years, about 164 feet/100,000 years. Accumulation rates estimated from regressions of the composite stratigraphic section, which is made up of stratigraphic intervals deposited in many areas of past subsidence for periods ranging from 200 to 700 thousand years during the past 1.8 million years, range from 171 to 270 feet/100,000 years and average 218 feet/100,000 years, a rate that is 33 percent greater than the previous (1994) estimated subsidence rate. Although average accumulation rates in wells at and near the ICPP and TRA agree with the previous (1994) estimated subsidence rate, these rates include two apparent rates that are a relative measure of the difference between past rates of contemporaneous subsidence and uplift, based on deep drill-hole data. The best estimates of past subsidence rates range from about 160 to 280 feet/100,000 years and average about 220 feet/100,000 years, based on the previous (1994) estimated subsidence rate and accumulation rates unaffected by differential subsidence or uplift. Estimated subsidence rates averaged about 192 feet/100,000 years and were much greater than accumulation rates during the past 200 thousand years, a period of greatly reduced volcanism. This interruption in basalt accumulation, which is unlike that of earlier periods and continues to the present day, includes most areas of the INEL.

The U.S. Geological Survey, in response to a request from the U.S. Department of Energy's Pittsburgh Naval Reactors Office, Idaho Branch Office, sampled water from 14 wells during 1994-95 as part of a long-term project to monitor water quality of the Snake River Plain aquifer in the vicinity of the Naval Reactors Facility, Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, Idaho. Water samples were analyzed for naturally occurring constituents and manmade contaminants. A total of 111 samples were collected from 10 monitoring wells and 4 production wells. Twelve quality assurance samples also were collected and analyzed; 1 was a blank sample and 11 were replicate samples. The blank sample contained concentrations of one inorganic constituent, one organic constituent, and five radioactive constituents that were greater than the reporting levels. Concentrations of other constituents in the blank sample were less than their respective reporting levels. The 11 replicate samples and their respective primary samples generated 293 pairs of analytical results for a variety of chemical and radiochemical constituents. Of the 293 data pairs, 258 were statistically equivalent at the 95-percent confidence level; about 88 percent of the analytical results were in agreement.

Radiochemical and chemical wastewater discharged since 1952 to infiltration ponds and disposal wells at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) has affected water quality in the Snake River Plain aquifer. The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, maintains a monitoring network at the INEL to determine hydrologic trends and to delineate the movement of radiochemical and chemical wastes in the aquifer. This report presents an analysis of water-level and water-quality data collected from the Snake River Plain aquifer during 1992-95.

Water in the Snake River Plain aquifer moves principally through fractures and interflow zones in basalt, generally flows southwestward, and eventually discharges at springs along the Snake River. The aquifer is recharged principally from infiltration of irrigation water, infiltration of streamflow, and ground-water inflow from adjoining mountain drainage basins. Water levels in wells throughout the INEL generally declined during 1992-95 because of drought.

Detectable concentrations of radiochemical constituents in water samples from wells in the Snake River Plain aquifer at the INEL decreased or remained constant during 1992-95. Decreased concentrations are attributed to reduced rates of radioactive-waste disposal, sorption processes, radioactive decay, and changes in waste-disposal practices. Tritium concentrations in water samples decreased as much as 16.6 picocuries per milliliter (pCi/mL) during 1992-95 and ranged from 0.610.2 to 25.1±1.0 pCi/mL in 1995. Strontium-90 concentrations remained constant during 1992-95 and ranged from 2.6±0.7 to 76±3 picocuries per liter in 1995. During 1992-95, the concentrations of cobalt-60, cesium-137, plutonium-238, and plutonium-239, -240 (undivided) in water samples from all wells sampled at the INEL were below the reporting level.

Detectable concentrations of chemical constituents in water from the Snake River Plain aquifer at the INEL were variable during 1992-95. In 1995, water from one well south of the Test Reactor Area contained 170 micrograms per liter (ug/L) of dissolved chromium; other water samples contained from less than 5 to 20 ug/L. Sodium and chloride concentrations in the southern part of the INEL increased slightly or remained constant during 1992-95 because of long-term increased waste-disposal rates and a lack of recharge from the Big Lost River. Nitrate concentrations remained relatively constant during 1992-95 even though waste-disposal rates decreased.

During 1992-95, concentrations of 1 to 14 purgeable organic compounds were detected in water from wells at the INEL. A plume of 1,1,1- trichloroethane has developed near the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant. Concentrations of several purgeable organic compounds exceeded their reporting levels in wells at or near the Radioactive Waste Management Complex as a result of waste-disposal practices.

The U.S. Geological Survey and the Idaho Department of Water Resources, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, evaluated the water quality data collected from 55 wells and springs during 1989 and 1990 through 1992 from the southern boundary of the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory to the Hagerman area, Idaho. Water samples collected in 1989-92 were analyzed for selected radionuclides, inorganic constituents, and organic compounds. A statistical comparison between data collected in 1989 and data collected in 1990-92 along with a comparison of replicate pairs was used to evaluate changes in water quality between samples and to assess sampling and analysis precision for individual constituents.

The comparisons of radionuclide data showed no pattern of water quality change between samples as concentrations randomly increased or decreased. Tritium concentrations did show a consistent pattern with location in the aquifer. The largest tritium concentrations occurred in water from wells in the Big Wood and Little Wood River drainages and in the southern part of the study area where heavy irrigation occurs. The variability of radionuclide concentrations may be attributed to the change in the contract laboratory used for radiochemical analyses between 1989 and 1990. The replicate data for radionuclides showed better overall reproducibility for data collected in 1990-92 than for 1989, as 70 of 76 replicate pairs were statistically equivalent for 1990-92 data whereas only 55 of 73 replicate pairs were equivalent for 1989 data.

The comparisons of most of the inorganic constituent data showed no statistical change between samples. Exceptions include nitrite plus nitrate as nitrogen and orthophosphate as phosphorus data. Fifteen sample pairs for nitrite plus nitrate and 18 sample pairs for orthophosphate were not statistically equivalent and concentrations randomly increased or decreased. Nitrite plus nitrate concentrations showed a consistent pattern with location as concentrations were larger in agriculture areas than in rangeland areas. The replicate data for inorganic constituents showed good reproducibility as 117 of 120 replicate pairs were statistically equivalent.

The comparison of most of the organic compound data showed no statistical change between samples. Anionic surfactants is an exception as only 13 of 55 sample pairs were statistically equivalent and values randomly increased or decreased. Most of the purgeable organic compounds, insecticides, herbicides, and polychlorinated compounds had concentrations below the laboratory reporting levels and were considered statistically equivalent. The replicate data for organic compounds showed good reproducibility as all but three replicate pairs were statistically equivalent.

The U.S. Geological Survey and the Idaho Department of Water Resources, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, sampled 19 sites as part of the fourth round of a long-term project to monitor water quality of the Snake River Plain aquifer from the southern boundary of the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory to the Hagerman area. Water samples were collected and analyzed for selected radiochemical and chemical constituents. The samples were collected from nine irrigation wells, three domestic wells, two dairy wells, two springs, one commercial well, one stock well, and one observation well. Two quality-assurance samples also were collected and analyzed. Additional sampling at six sites was done to complete the third round of sampling.

None of the radiochemical or chemical constituents exceeded the established maximum contaminant levels for drinking water. Many of the radionuclide- and inorganic-constituent concentrations were greater than their respective reporting levels.

Delineation of areas at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory that would be inundated by a 100-year peak flow in Birch Creek is needed by the U.S. Department of Energy to fulfill flood-plain regulatory requirements. Birch Creek flows southward about 40 miles through an alluvium-filled valley onto the northern part of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory site on the eastern Snake River Plain. The lower 10-mile reach of Birch Creek that ends in Birch Creek Playa near several Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory facilities is of particular concern. Birch Creek is highly braided, and many anthropogenic features in the study area affect flood hydraulics and flow.

Dikes surround two of the facilities in and around the playa. At the elevation of the top of the dikes, Birch Creek Playa has a volume of 21,600 acre-feet, greater than the volume of 13,000 acre-feet that would be generated by the hypothetical 100-year peak flow. The water surface elevation resulting from a volume of 13,000 acre-feet is about 2 feet lower than the elevation of the dikes; therefore, no flooding of the facilities would be expected from the hypothetical 100-year peak flow.

Twenty-six channel cross sections were surveyed to develop and apply a hydraulic model to simulate water-surface elevations for a hypothetical 100-year peak flow in Birch Creek. Model simulation of the 100-year peak flow (700 cubic feet per second) in reaches upstream from State Highway 22 indicated that flow was confined within channels even when all flow was routed to one channel. Where the highway crosses Birch Creek, about 315 cubic feet per second of water was estimated to move downstream 115 cubic feet per second through a culvert and 200 cubic feet per second over the highway. Simulated water-surface elevation at this crossing was 0.8 foot higher than the elevation of the highway. The remaining 385 cubic feet per second flowed southwestward in a trench along the north side of the highway. Flow also was simulated with the culvert removed. Only the maximum flow capacities were determined for diversion channels because they probably would be at full capacity during peak flow.

The exact location of flood boundaries on Birch Creek could not be determined because of the highly braided channel and the many anthropogenic features (such as the trench, highway, and diversion channels) in the study area that affect flood hydraulics and flow. Because flood boundaries could not be located exactly, only a generalized flood-prone map was developed. Upstream from Highway 22, peak flows were confined within the braided channels. At Highway 22 and downstream, flows spread out, probably due to the anthropogenic features. If the anthropogenic features were not present, peak flows probably would be confined within the braided channels of Birch Creek.

In 1991, the U.S. Geological Survey collected a 160-meter (m) ice core from the Upper Fremont Glacier (43°07′N, 109°36′W) in the Wind River Mountain Range of Wyoming in the western United States [1]. In 1994–1995, ice from this core was processed at the National Ice Core Laboratory in Denver, Colorado, and analyzed for chlorine-36 (<sup>36</sup>Cl) by accelerator mass spectrometry at PRIME Laboratory, Purdue University. A tritium bomb peak identified in the work by [1] was used as a marker to estimate the depth of bomb-produced <sup>36</sup>Cl. Tritium concentrations ranged from 0 tritium units (TU) for older ice to more than 300 TU at 29 m below the surface of the glacier, a depth that includes ice that was deposited as snow during nuclear-weapons tests through the early 1960's. Maximum <sup>36</sup>Cl production during nuclear-weapons tests was in the late 1950's; therefore, the analyses were performed on ice from a depth of 29.8 to 32 m. Calculated flux for <sup>36</sup>Cl in ice deposited in the late 1950's ranged from 1.2±0.1×10<sup>-1</sup> atoms/cm2 s for ice from 29.8 to 30.4 m, to 2.9±0.1×10<sup>-1</sup> atoms/cm2 s for ice from 31.5 to 32.0 m. Ice samples from a depth of 104.7 to 106.3 m were selected to represent pre-weapons tests <sup>36</sup>Cl flux. Calculated flux for <sup>36</sup>Cl in this deeper ice was 4.6±0.8×10<sup>-3</sup> atoms/cm2 s for ice from 104.7 to 105.5 m and 2.0±0.2×10<sup>-2</sup> atoms/cm<sup>2</sup> s for ice from 105.5 to 106.3 m. These flux calculations from the Upper Fremont Glacier analyses are the first for bomb-produced <sup>36</sup>Cl in ice from a mid-latitude glacier in North America. It may now be possible to fully quantify the flux of <sup>36</sup>Cl from nuclear-weapons tests archived in mid-latitude glacial ice and to gain a better understanding of the distribution of <sup>36</sup>Cl and other cosmogenic nuclides.

The age and paleomagnetism were determined on basalt from 27 lava flows represented in about 1,900 feet of core from corehole ANL-OBS-AQ-014 in the area of the Argonne National Laboratory-West facilities of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). Paleomagnetic study was also made on an additional core from a shallow corehole located a mile east of that facility. Paleomagnetic measurements were made on 462 samples from the two coreholes, which are compared to each other, and to surface outcrop paleomagnetic data. <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar measurements were made on 5 basalt samples over the length of core ANLOBS-AQ-014, and these samples range in age from 565 ka to 1.75 Ma. The pattern of accumulation suggested by these ages is irregular. Very rapid rates (>3,000'/m.y.) quickly piled up hundreds of feet of lava in different time-separated events, interspersed with eruptive hiatuses, some of which may have lasted 650 k.y.

In 1990, the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, Idaho Operations Office, established the Lithologic Core Storage Library at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL). The facility was established to consolidate, catalog, and permanently store nonradioactive drill cores and cuttings from investigations of the subsurface conducted at the INEL, and to provide a location for researchers to examine, sample, and test these materials.

The facility is open by appointment to researchers for examination, sampling, and testing of cores and cuttings. This report describes the facility and cores and cuttings stored at the facility. Descriptions of cores and cuttings include the well names, well locations, and depth intervals available. Most cores and cuttings stored at the facility were drilled at or near the INEL, on the eastern Snake River Plain; however, two cores drilled on the western Snake River Plain are stored for comparative studies. Basalt, rhyolite, sedimentary interbeds, and surficial sediments compose the majority of cores and cuttings, most of which are continuous from land surface to their total depth. The deepest core stored at the facility was drilled to 5,000 feet below land surface. This report describes procedures and researchers' responsibilities for access to the facility, and examination, sampling, and return of materials.

## KnobelOthers1997

The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, is conducting a study to determine the natural geochemistry of the Snake River Plain aquifer system at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL), Idaho. As part of this study, a group of geochemical reactions that partially control the natural chemistry of ground water at the INEL were identified. Mineralogy of the aquifer matrix was determined using X-ray diffraction and thin-section analysis and theoretical stabilities of the minerals were used to identify potential solid-phase reactants and products of the reactions. The reactants and products that have an important contribution to the natural geochemistry include labradorite, olivine, pyroxene, smectite, calcite, ferric oxyhydroxide, and several silica phases.

To further identify the reactions, analyses of 22 representative water samples from sites tapping the Snake River Plain aquifer system were used to determine the thermodynamic condition of the ground water relative to the minerals in the framework of the aquifer system. Principal reactions modifying the natural geochemical system include congruent dissolution of olivine, diopside, amorphous silica, and anhydrite; incongruent dissolution of labradorite with calcium montmorillonite as a residual product; precipitation of calcite and ferric oxyhydroxide; and oxidation of ferrous iron to ferric iron. Cation exchange reactions retard the downward movement of heavy, multivalent waste constituents where infiltration ponds are used for waste disposal.

Strontium distribution coefficients (K<sub>d</sub>'s) were measured for 20 surficial sediment samples collected from selected sites at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL). The measurements were made to help assess the variability of strontium K<sub>d</sub>'s found at the INEL as part of an ongoing investigation of strontium chemical transport properties of surficial and interbedded sediments at the INEL. The investigation is being conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey and Idaho State University in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy. Batch experimental techniques were used to determine K<sub>d</sub>'s of surficial sediments using a synthesized aqueous solution representative of wastewater in waste disposal ponds at the INEL. Strontium K<sub>d</sub>'s of the 20 surficial sediments ranged from 36±1 to 275±6 milliliters per gram. These results indicate significant variability in the strontium sorptive capacities of surficial sediments at the INEL. Some of this variability can be attributed to physical and chemical properties of the sediment itself; however, the remainder of the variability may be due to compositional changes in the equilibrated solutions after being mixed with the sediment.

## ReedOthers1997

Thirty-nine samples of basaltic core were collected from wells 121 and 123, located approximately 1.8 km apart north and south of the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. Samples were collected from depths ranging from 15 to 221 m below land surface for the purpose of establishing stratigraphic correlations between these two wells. Elemental analyses indicate that the basalts consist of three principal chemical types. Two of these types are each represented by a single basalt flow in each well. The third chemical type is represented by many basalt flows and includes a broad range of chemical compositions that is distinguished from the other two types. Basalt flows within the third type were identified by hierarchical K-cluster analysis of 14 representative elements: Fe, Ca, K, Na, Sc, Co, La, Ce, Sm, Eu, Yb, Hf, Ta, and Th. Cluster analyses indicate correlations of basalt flows between wells 121 and 123 at depths of approximately 38–40 m, 125–128 m, 131–137 m, 149–158 m, and 183–198 m. Probable correlations also are indicated for at least seven other depth intervals. Basalt flows in several depth intervals do not correlate on the basis of chemical compositions, thus reflecting possible flow margins in the sequence between the wells. Multi-element chemical data provide a useful method for determining stratigraphic correlations of basalt in the upper 1–2 km of the eastern Snake River Plain.

More than 4,000 water samples were collected by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) from 179 monitoring sites for the water-quality monitoring program at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory from 1994 through 1995. Approximately 500 of the water samples were replicate or blank samples collected for the quality assurance/quality control program. Analyses were performed to determine the concentrations of major ions, nutrients, trace elements, gross radioactivity and radionuclides, total organic carbon, and volatile organic compounds in the samples.

To evaluate the precision of field and laboratory methods, analytical results of the replicate pairs of samples were compared statistically for equivalence on the basis of the precision associated with each result. In all, the statistical comparison of the data indicated that 95 percent of the replicate pairs were equivalent. Within the major ion analyses, 97 percent were equivalent; nutrients, 88 percent; trace elements, 95 percent; gross radioactivity and radionuclides, 93 percent; and organic constituents, 98 percent. Ninety percent or more of the analytical results for each constituent were equivalent, except for nitrite, orthophosphate, phosphorus, aluminum, iron, strontium-90, and total organic carbon.

Blank-sample analytical results indicated that the inorganic blank water and volatile organic compound blank water from the USGS National Water Quality Laboratory and the deionized water from the USGS Idaho Falls Field Office were suitable source solutions for blanks. Equipment- and trip-blank analytical results were evaluated to determine if a bias had been introduced and the possible sources of bias. The results indicated that none of the blanks had measurable concentrations of the constituents of interest, except one equipment blank that had measurable concentrations of total organic carbon, gross radioactivity, and tritium.

In May and June 1995, a Russian-American research team sampled the flowing Ob River system, including the suspended and bed sediments, for determination of radionuclide concentrations. The research team consisted of seven Russian scientists from the State Hydrologic Institute, St. Petersburg, and four hydrologists from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Water samples were collected using high-volume peristaltic pumps, then were prefiltered through 63-micrometer (μm) nylon media and filtered sequentially through 0.45-μm and 10,000-dalton tangential-flow ultrafiltration systems. Samples were collected from five stations along the Ob River system representing channel length of >3,500 km from the headwaters in central Siberia to the Ob Gulf on the Kara Sea. Two known nuclear-weapons production facilities on this river system are the probable sources of the radionuclides measured.

Chlorine-36 (<sup>36</sup>Cl) concentrations were determined by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) for 500 mL (milliliter) water samples prefiltered through the 63-μm nylon media. Concentrations of <sup>36</sup>Cl were measured at all five stations and ranged from 4.0±0.1x10<sup>7</sup> atoms/L for the sample only influenced by nuclear-weapons testing and not by waste disposal (station 1) to 2.4±.03x10<sup>9</sup> atoms/L for the sample nearest a plutonium production facility (station 2). The <sup>36</sup>Cl concentration for the sample from the station most distant from any waste source and nearest to the Ob Gulf (station 5) was 5.0±0.2x10<sup>8</sup> atoms/L.

Plutonium (Pu) isotopic concentrations and strontium-90 (<sup>90</sup>Sr) concentrations were determined by conventional decay-counting methods. The only Pu isotopes detected in 20 L water samples were <sup>238</sup>Pu at station 1 and <sup>239</sup>Pu at station 2. No detectable concentrations of <sup>90</sup>Sr were measured in 400 mL water samples from any of the stations. Gamma-spectroscopy measurements also showed no detectable concentrations of anthropogenic gamma-emitting radionuclides from the 20 L water samples. These results suggest that AMS offers a method of determining radioactivity concentrations in the environment at greater distances away from a source than do conventional decay-counting methods because of the smaller analytical method detection limit associated with AMS for select radionuclides.

In 1991, the U.S. Geological Survey collected a 159.7-m ice core from the Upper Fremont Glacier in the Wind River Range, Wyoming (Naftz et al. 1993). In 1994, the ice was processed at the National Ice Core Laboratory in Denver, Colorado, and analyzed for chlorine-36 (<sup>36</sup>Cl) by accelerator mass spectrometry at Purdue University. A tritium bomb peak identified in the work by Naftz and others was used as a marker to estimate the depth of bomb-produced <sup>36</sup>Cl. Tritium concentrations ranged from 0 tritium units (TU) for older ice to >300 TU at 29 m below the ice surface, a depth that includes ice that was deposited during nuclear-weapons tests through the early 1960s. Maximum <sup>36</sup>Cl production during nuclear-weapons tests was in the late 1950s; therefore, the analyses were performed on ice from a depth of 29.8 to 32 m. Calculated flux for <sup>36</sup>Cl in ice deposited in the late 1950s ranged from 4.5±0.1x10<sup>6</sup> atoms/cm<sup>2</sup> yr for a 0.6-m section of ice centered at a depth of 30.1 m to 11±0.2x10<sup>6</sup> atoms/cm<sup>2</sup> yr for a 0.5-m section of ice centered at a depth of 31.8 m. Ice samples from a depth of 104.7 to 106.3 m were selected to represent pre-weapons tests <sup>36</sup>Cl flux. Calculated flux for <sup>36</sup>Cl in this deeper ice was 1.7±0.2x10<sup>5</sup> atoms/cm<sup>2</sup> yr for a 0.8-m section of ice centered at a depth of 105.1 m and 7.4±0.4x10<sup>5</sup> atoms/cm<sup>2</sup> yr for a 0.8-m section of ice centered at a depth of 105.9 m. These flux calculations from the Upper Fremont Glacier analyses are the first for bomb-produced <sup>36</sup>Cl in ice from a mid-latitude glacier in North America.

A Stratigraphic data base containing 230 stratigraphic units in 333 wells was constructed for deposits that make up the unsaturated zone and the Snake River Plain aquifer at and near the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory in eastern Idaho. Stratigraphic units, which were identified and correlated using the data from numerous outcrops, 26 continuous cores, and 328 natural-gamma logs available in December 1993, include 121 basalt-flow groups, 102 sedimentary interbeds, 6 andesite-flow groups, and 1 rhyolite dome. By volume, basalt flows make up about 90 percent of the deposits underlying most of this 890 mi<sup>2</sup> area.

Several types of data were used to identify and correlate Stratigraphic units. Basalt, sediment, andesite, and rhyolite were identified from outcrops and cores that were selectively evaluated for paleomagnetic inclination and polarity, K-Ar and <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar ages, petrographic characteristics, and major-oxide and trace-element chemical composition. Stratigraphic units were correlated using these data and natural-gamma logs, which respond to potassium contents of less than 1 percent in basalt to more than 4 percent in rhyolite. The best correlations, were obtained for basalt and sediment at Test Area North, the Naval Reactors Area, the Test Reactor Area, the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant, and the Radioactive Waste Management Complex, where most cores and two thirds of the logs were obtained. Correlations range from good at the Radioactive Waste Management Complex to uncertain in the eastern half of the study area.

Copies of the Stratigraphic data are contained on a 3 1/2-inch diskette included with this report. The data are presented in two styles in American Standard Code for Information Interchange(ASCII) format Two files, one for well-site information and one for Stratigraphic information, are presented with comma delimited fields. These two files are suitable for creation of a Stratigraphic data base by most software capable of importing raw data. A third file presents the well information and Stratigraphic information as text in a table format, generally one page per well. The files occupy 0.03, 0.26, and 0.81 megabyte disk space respectively.

Thickness of surficial sediment was determined from natural-gamma logs in 333 wells at and near the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory in eastern Idaho to provide reconnaissance data for future site-characterization studies. Surficial sediment, which is defined as the unconsolidated clay, silt, sand, and gravel that overlie the uppermost basalt flow at each well, ranges in thickness from 0 feet in seven wells drilled through basalt outcrops east of the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant to 313 feet in well Site 14 southeast of the Big Lost River sinks. Surficial sediment includes alluvial, lacustrine, eolian, and colluvial deposits that generally accumulated during the past 200 thousand years. Additional thickness data, not included in this report, are available from numerous auger holes and foundation borings at and near most facilities.

Water from 28 wells completed in the Snake River Plain aquifer at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) was sampled as part of the U.S. Geological Survey's quality-assurance program to determine the effect of different preservation methods on nutrient concentrations. Samples were preserved with filtration and with mercuric chloride and chilling, chilling only, or sulfuric acid and chilling. The samples were analyzed for ammonia, nitrite, nitrite plus nitrate, and orthophosphate by the U.S. Geological Survey National Water Quality Laboratory. The study was done in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy.

The comparison between samples preserved with mercuric chloride and chilling and samples preserved by chilling only showed that all sample pairs were in statistical agreement. Results for ammonia and nitrite plus nitrate samples preserved with sulfuric acid and chilling were within the 95-percent confidence level of the results for the samples preserved by the other two methods and can be considered equivalent to them. Results of this study indicate that discontinuing the use of mercuric chloride as a preservation method for nutrients in water samples will not affect the comparability of data collected at the INEL before and after October 1,1994.

The U.S. Geological Survey and the Idaho Department of Water Resources, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, sampled 17 sites as part of a long-term project to monitor water quality of the Snake River Plain aquifer from the southern boundary of the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory to the Hagerman area. Water samples were collected and analyzed for selected radionuclides, stable isotopes, inorganic constituents, and organic compounds. The samples were collected from 11 irrigation wells, 2 domestic wells, 2 stock wells, 1 spring, and 1 public-supply well. Two quality assurance samples also were collected and analyzed.

None of the radionuclide, inorganic constituent, or organic compound concentrations exceeded the established maximum contaminant levels for drinking water. Many of the radionuclide and inorganic constituent concentrations were greater than their respective reporting levels. All samples analyzed for dissolved organic carbon had concentrations that were greater than the minimum reporting level.

Peak flows and flow volumes with recurrence intervals of 100 years for the Big Lost River and Birch Creek were estimated so that the extent of the 100-year flood plain at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory could be delineated. Flows entering the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory area were estimated from flood-frequency analysis of data at gaging stations, from regional regression equations, and from channel-infiltration losses. The one-dimensional flow model FOURPT was used to route peak flow through a deep, basalt gorge between the Arco gaging station and the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory boundary. Results indicated that no adjustments to attenuation of the peak were needed at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory's western boundary.

Estimates of flow volumes entering the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory area were made by using representative hydrographs at selected gaging stations. Representative hydrographs were developed by fitting the 1-, 3-, 7-, 15-, 30-, and 60- day mean flows having a recurrence interval of 100 years to a smooth curve. Estimated peak flow for a recurrence interval of 100 years entering the boundary of the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory from the Big Lost River was 7,260 cubic feet per second. The estimated volume of flow for a 60-day period for a recurrence interval of 100 years was 390,000 acre-feet. For Birch Creek, the estimated peak flow for a recurrence interval of100 years entering the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory area was 700 cubic feet per second, and the estimated 60-day volume of flow with a recurrence interval of 100 years was about 10,600 acre-feet.

In the next phase of this flood-plain delineation study, the 100-year peak flow will be routed downstream to spreading areas and playas in the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory area using a computer model to delineate the extent of the 100-year flood plain.

Water-quality activities at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) Project Office are part of the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Water Resources Division (WRD) mission of appraising the quantity and quality of the Nation's water resources. The activities are conducted in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Idaho Operations Office and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 10. Results of the water-quality investigations are presented in various USGS publications or in refereed scientific journals. The results of the studies are highly regarded and are used with confidence by researchers, regulatory and managerial agencies, and interested civic groups.

In its broadest sense, quality assurance refers to doing the job right, the first time. It includes the functions of planning for products, review and acceptance of the products, and an audit designed to evaluate the system that produces the product. Quality assurance and quality control differ in that: quality control ensures that things are done correctly given the “state-of-the-art” technology; and quality assurance ensures that quality control is maintained within specified limits.

Geophysical well logs run under five different casing conditions during the drilling and removal of casing from borehole ANL-OBS-A-001 at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory are presented with depth-adjustment for correlation with detailed core descriptions. Borehole televiewer image logs provide useful information regarding the details of fractures and basalt interflow openings in situ, and allow the proper positioning of fragmented core or recovered core sections where short intervals have been lost. Borehole flow logs indicate the specific features described on core and indicated on geophysical logs that are associated with inflow to or outflow from the borehole under ambient hydraulic head conditions. Acoustic logs and a short interval of acoustic wave-form log data are used to evaluate the results from shear suspension logging as part of a seismic properties study designed to measure compressional and shear velocity at a scale of investigation larger than that associated with acoustic logs. The acoustic transit-time logs give measurements of acoustic transit time that agree with those from the suspension logging, except in the interval below 1735 feet in depth where the near receiver data obtained in the suspension logging were not reliable. However, comparison of waveforms obtained from the acoustic and suspension logging probes indicates that shear velocity estimated from the suspension log waveforms may underestimate formation shear velocity. This result is attributed to the known difference between shear wave group velocity and formation shear velocity for the suspension logging system.

## Williams1996

Hundreds of water samples were collected by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) from 177 monitoring sites for the water-quality monitoring program at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory from 1989 through 1993. Concurrently, replicate pairs of samples and various types of blank samples were collected as part of the quality assurance/quality control program. Analyses were performed to determine the concentrations of major ions, nutrients, trace elements, gross radioactivity and radionuclides, organic compounds, and total organic carbon in the samples.

To evaluate the precision of field and laboratory methods, analytical results of the replicate pairs of samples were compared statistically for equivalence on the basis of the precision associated with each result. Ninety percent or more of the analytical results for each constituent were equivalent, except for ammonia plus organic nitrogen, orthophosphate, iron, manganese, radium-226, total organic carbon, and total phenols.

Blank-sample analytical results indicated that the inorganic-free blank water from the USGS Quality of Water Service Unit and the deionized water from the USGS Idaho Falls Field Office were suitable source solutions for blanks. Waters from other sources were found to be unsatisfactory as blank source solutions. Results of the analyses of several equipment blanks were evaluated to determine if a bias had been introduced and the possible sources of the bias. All of the equipment-blank analytical results indicated that ammonia concentrations were greater than the reporting level. None of the equipment blanks had measurable concentrations of radioactivity. Eight percent of the analyses for inorganic constituents showed measurable concentrations were present in the blanks, nine percent for radioactive constituents, and less than one percent for organic constituents.

## Ackerman1995

Quantitative estimates of ground-water flow directions and travel times for advective flow were developed for the regional aquifer system of the eastern Snake River Plain, Idaho. The work included: (1) descriptions of compartments in the aquifer that function as intermediate and regional flow systems, (2) descriptions of pathlines for flow originating at or near the water table, and (3) quantitative estimates of travel times for advective transport originating at or near the water table.

A particle-tracking postprocessing program was used to compute pathlines on the basis of output from an existing three-dimensional steady-state flow model. The flow model uses 1980 conditions to approximate average annual conditions for 1950-80.

The advective transport model required additional information about the nature of flow across model boundaries, aquifer thickness, and porosity. Porosity of two types of basalt strata has been reported for more than 1,500 individual cores from test holes, wells, and outcrops near the south side of the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. The central 80 percent of samples had porosities of 0.08 to 0.25, the central 50 percent of samples, 0.11 to 0.21.

Calibration of the model involved choosing a value for porosity that yielded the best solution. Two radiologic contaminants, iodine-129 and tritium, both introduced to the flow system about 40 years ago, are relatively conservative tracers. Iodine- 129 was considered to be more useful because of a lower analytical detection limit, longer half-life, and longer flow path. The calibration value for porosity was 0.21.

Most flow in the aquifer is contained within a regional-scale compartment and follows paths that discharge to the Snake River downstream from Milner Dam. Two intermediate-scale compartments exist along the southeast side of the aquifer and near Mud Lake. One intermediate-scale compartment along the southeast side of the aquifer discharges to the Snake River near American Fails Reservoir and covers an area of nearly 1,000 square miles. This compartment, which receives recharge from an area of intensive surface-water irrigation, is apparently fairly stable. The other intermediate-scale compartment near Mud Lake covers an area of 300 square miles. The stability and size of this compartment are uncertain, but are assumed to be in a state of change.

Travel times for advective flow from the water table to discharge points in the regional compartment ranged from 12 to 350 years for 80 percent of the particles; in the intermediate-scale flow compartment near American Falls Reservoir, from 7 to 60 years for 80 percent of the particles; and in the intermediate-scale compartment near Mud Lake, from 25 to 100 years for 80 percent of the particles.

Travel times are sensitive to porosity and assumptions regarding the importance of the strength of internal sinks, which represent ground-water pumpage. A decrease in porosity results in shorter travel times but not a uniform decrease in travel time, because the porosity and thickness is different in each model layer. Most flow was horizontal and occurred in the top 500 feet of the aquifer.

An important limitation of the model is the assumption of steady-state flow. The most recent trend in the flow system has been a decrease in recharge since 1987 because of an extended drought and changes in land use. A decrease in flow through the system will result in longer travel times than those predicted for a greater flow. Because the interpretation of the model was limited to flow on a larger scale, and did not consider individual wells or well fields, the interpretations were not seriously limited by the discretization of well discharge.

The interpretations made from this model also were limited by the discretization of the major discharge areas. Near discharge areas, pathlines might not be representative at the resolution of the grid. Most improvement in the estimates of ground-waterflow directions and travel times for advective flow could be gained by better estimates of recharge from surface-water irrigation.

## AndersonBowers1995

A complex sequence of basalt flows and sedimentary interbeds underlies Test Area North (TAN) at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory in eastern Idaho. Wells drilled to depths of at least 500 feet penetrate 10 basalt-flow groups and 5 to 10 sedimentary interbeds that range in age from about 940,000 to 1.4 million years. Each basalt-flow group consists of one or more basalt flows from a brief, single or compound eruption. All basalt flows of each group erupted from the same vent and have similar ages, paleomagnetic properties, potassium contents, and natural-gamma emissions. Sedimentary interbeds consist of fluvial, lacustrine, and eolian deposits of clay, silt, sand, and gravel that accumulated for hundreds to hundreds of thousands of years during periods of volcanic quiescence. Basalt and sediment arc elevated by hundreds of feet with respect to rocks of equivalent age south and east of the area, a relation that is attributed to past uplift at TAN. Basalt and sediment are unsaturated to a depth of about 200 feet below land surface. Rocks below this depth are saturated and make up the Snake River Plain aquifer. The effective base of the aquifer is at a depth of 885 feet below land surface. Detailed stratigraphic relations for the lowermost part of the aquifer in the depth interval from 500 to 885 feet were not determined because of insufficient data.

The stratigraphy of basalt-flow groups and sedimentary interbeds in the upper 500 feet of the unsaturated zone and aquifer was determined from natural-gamma logs, lithologic logs, and well cores. Basalt cores were evaluated for potassiumargon ages, paleomagnetic properties, petrographic characteristics, and chemical composition. Stratigraphic control was provided by differences in ages, paleomagnetic properties, potassium content, and natural-gamma emissions of basalt-flow groups and sedimentary interbeds.

Radiochemical and chemical wastewater discharged since 1952 to infiltration ponds and disposal wells at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) has affected water quality in the Snake River Plain aquifer. The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, maintains a continuous monitoring network at the INEL to determine hydrologic trends and to delineate the movement of radiochemical and chemical wastes in the aquifer. This report presents an analysis of water-level and water-quality data collected from the Snake River Plain aquifer during 1989-91.

Water in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer moves principally through fractures and interflow zones in basalt, generally flows southwestward, and eventually discharges at springs along the Snake River. The aquifer is recharged principally from irrigation water, infiltration of streamflow, and ground-water inflow from adjoining mountain drainage basins. Water levels in wells throughout the INEL generally declined during 1989-91 due to drought.

Detectable concentrations of radiochemical constituents in water samples from wells in the Snake River Plain aquifer at the INEL decreased or remained constant during 1989-9 1. Decreased concentrations are attributed to reduced rates of radioactive-waste disposal, sorption processes, radioactive decay, and changes in waste-disposal practices. Tritium concentrations in water samples decreased as much as 23.8 picocuries per milliliter (pCi/mL) during 1989-91 and ranged from 0.6±0.2 to 41.7±0.9 pCi/mL in 1991. Strontium-90 concentrations remained constant during 1989-91 and ranged from 9±3 to 55±4 picocuries per liter in 1991. In 1989, the concentrations of cobalt-60, cesium-137, plutonium-238, and plutonium-239, -240 (undivided) in water samples from one well at the Test Area North were above the reporting level.

Detectable concentrations of chemical constituents in water from the Snake River Plain aquifer at the INEL were variable during 1989-91. Sodium and chloride concentrations in the southern part of the INEL increased slightly during 1989-91 because of increased waste-disposal rates and a lack of recharge from the Big Lost River. Nitrate concentrations remained relatively constant during 1989-91 even though waste-disposal rates decreased. In 1991, water from one well south of the Test Reactors Area contained 200 micrograms per liter (μg/L) of dissolved chromium; other water samples contained from less than 1 to 30 μg/L.

During 1987-91, concentrations of at least 1 of 19 purgeable organic compounds were detected in water from wells at the INEL. Plumes of 1,1,1-trichloroethane have developed near the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant and the Radioactive Waste Management Complex as a result of waste-disposal practices.

This report presents chemical compositions determined from 84 subsamples and 5 quality-assurance split subsamples of basalt core from the eastern Snake River Plain. The 84 subsamples were collected at selected depths from 5 coreholes located on the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, Idaho. This report was jointly prepared by Lockheed Idaho Technologies Company and the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, Idaho Operations Office.

Ten major elements and as many as 32 trace elements were determined for each subsample either by wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, or by both methods. Descriptive statistics for each element were calculated and tabulated by analytical method for each corehole.

The Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL), encompassing approximately 890 m<sup>2</sup> in the north-central part of the eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP), was established in 1949 by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, now the Department of Energy (DOE), as a site for building and testing various types of nuclear facilities. The operation of such facilities generated liquid and solid radioactive waste requiring disposal within INEL boundaries. The Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP) was established to dispose of chemical waste and for reprocessing spent fuel rods produced at the INEL.

Basalt stratigraphy, a fundamental component in the hydrologic characterization beneath the ICPP, aids the understanding of subsurface pathways and processes which are essential for assessing the problem of migration of radioactive and chemical waste from the facility.

Thirty-nine samples of basaltic core from wells 121 and 123, located approximately 1.8 km apart on opposite sides of the ICPP were collected from depths ranging from 50 to 724 feet below land surface for the purpose of chemically constraining the correlations between these two wells. Elemental analyses of the basalts indicate three principal chemical types; two are each represented by a single flow unit (sampled in both wells), and the third includes a wide range of chemical subtypes involving several flows approximately 10 to 60 feet thick. Chemical distinction between flows within the third group was enabled by hierarchical K-cluster analysis of 14 representative elements (Fe, Ca, Na, K, Co, Sc, La, Ce, Sm, Eu, Yb, Hf, Ta and Th). Cluster analyses confirm the delineation of three chemical types and yielded positive correlation (high probability) of lava flows at depths of ~125-130 ft., ~410-420 ft., ~430-450 ft., ~500-515 ft., and ~600- 650 ft. Good correlations (moderate to high probability) also are established between at least 7 flows in the remainder of the sequence.

Several flow units were present in one location and not in the other, thus reflecting the existence of flow margins in the sequence between the wells. Flow margins possibly were related to the Big Lost River channel which may have provided topographic control on flow direction.

High level cluster analysis correlations and previous work for the approximately 130, 415, and 440 foot units indicate that there is little structural control on the basalt stratigraphy. This would support the idea of a series of eruptions happening at the same time and coalescing with each other producing shield volcanoes and eruptive centers associated with rift zones. This suggests a relative large area beneath the present-day INEL that was partially melted into discrete masses that erupted at different locations from the fissure system.

Multi-elemental signatures are shown to be essential for defining basalt stratigraphy and understanding the evolution of volcanics that comprise the upper 1-2 km of the ESRP. The interpretations from this study offer additional constraints on hydrologic conditions beneath the ICPP as well as a method of making more regional correlations beneath the INEL and over the ESRP. Since the majority of groundwater flow is at the basalts flow margins, this study suggests that vertical infiltration above the water table at the ICPP could be significant near flow-lobe edges, as well as horizontal flow below the water table along upper and lower flow contacts. The constraints from this study suggests that vertical infiltration above the water table could be significant in the transportation of waste.

## Shakofsky1995

In order to assess the effect of filled waste disposal trenches on transport-governing soil properties, comparisons were made between profiles of undisturbed soil and disturbed soil in a simulated waste trench. The changes in soil properties induced by the construction of a simulated waste trench were measured near the Radioactive Waste Management Complex at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) in the semi-arid southeast region of Idaho. The soil samples were collected, using a hydraulically-driven sampler to minimize sample disruption, from both a simulated waste trench and an undisturbed area nearby. Results show that the undisturbed profile has distinct layers whose properties differ significantly, whereas the soil profile in the simulated waste trench is, by comparison, homogeneous. Porosity was increased in the disturbed cores, and, correspondingly, saturated hydraulic conductivities were on average three times higher. With higher soil-moisture contents (greater than 0.32), unsaturated hydraulic conductivities for the undisturbed cores were typically greater than those for the disturbed cores. With lower moisture contents, most of the disturbed cores had greater hydraulic conductivities. The observed differences in hydraulic conductivities are interpreted and discussed as changes in the soil pore geometry.

The U.S. Geological Survey, in response to a request from the U.S. Department of Energy's Pittsburgh Naval Reactors Office, Idaho Branch Office, sampled 14 wells during 1991-93 as part of a long-term project to monitor water quality of the Snake River Plain aquifer in the vicinity of the Naval Reactors Facility, Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, Idaho. Water samples were analyzed for manmade contaminants and naturally occurring constituents. One hundred sixty-one samples were collected from 10 ground-water monitoring wells and 4 production wells. Twenty-one quality-assurance samples also were collected and analyzed; 2 were blank samples and 19 were replicate samples. The two blank samples contained concentrations of six inorganic constituents that were slightly greater than the laboratory reporting levels (the smallest measured concentration of a constituent that can be reported using a given analytical method). Concentrations of other constituents in the blank samples were less than their respective reporting levels. The 19 replicate samples and their respective primary samples generated 614 pairs of analytical results for a variety of chemical and radiochemical constituents. Of the 614 data pairs, 588 were statistically equivalent at the 95-percent confidence level; about 96 percent of the analytical results were in agreement. Two pairs of turbidity measurements were not evaluated because of insufficient information and one primary sample collected in January 1992 contained tentatively identified organic compounds when the replicate sample did not.

Concentrations of dissolved radon-222, a naturally occurring radioactive gas, are found in water in Idaho. The U.S. Geological Survey collected water samples for radon-222 analyses from 338 Idaho wells and springs during 1989-91. These water samples were collected as part of ongoing monitoring programs with the Idaho Department of Water Resources and the U.S. Department of Energy. Concentrations of dissolved radon-222 in 372 of the water samples ranged from -58±30 to 5,715±66 picocuries per liter; the mean and median concentrations were 446±35 and 242±25 picocuries per liter, respectively.

From 1953 to 1990, an estimated 0.56 to 1.18 curies of iodine-129 were contained in wastewater generated by the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP) at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. The wastewater was discharged directly to the Snake River Plain aquifer through a deep disposal well prior to February 1984 and through unlined disposal ponds from 1984 to 1990. The wastewater did not contain measurable concentrations of iodine-129 in 1989-90.

In 1990-91, samples were collected from 51 wells that obtain water from the Snake River Plain aquifer and 1 well that obtains water from a perched ground-water zone. The samples were analyzed for iodine-129 using the accelerator mass spectrometer method, which is two to six orders of magnitude more sensitive than neutron-activation methods. Therefore, iodine-129 was detectable in samples from a larger number of wells distributed over a larger area than previously was possible. Ground-water flow velocities calculated using iodine-129 data are at least 6 feet per day. These velocities compare favorably with those of 4 to 10 feet per day calculated using tritium data and tracer studies at wells downgradient from the ICPP.

In 1990-91, concentrations of iodine-129 in water samples from wells that obtain water from the Snake River Plain aquifer ranged from less than 0.0000006±0.0000002 to 3.82±0.19 picocuries per liter (pCi/L). The mean concentration in water from 18 wells was 0.81±0.19 pCi/L as compared with 1.30±0.26 pCi/L in 1986. The decrease in the iodine-129 concentrations from 1986 to 1990-91 chiefly was the result of a decrease in the amount of iodine-129 disposed of annually and changes in disposal techniques.

In 1990-93, tritium concentrations in water from 19 springs along the north side of the Snake River near Twin Falls and Hagerman ranged from 9.2±0.6 to 78.4±5.1 picocuries per liter (pCi/L). The springs were placed into three categories on the basis of their locations and tritium concentrations: Category I springs are the farthest upstream and contained from 52.8±3.2 to 78.4±5.1 pCi/L of tritium; Category II springs are downstream from those in Category I and contained from 9.2±0.6 to 18.5±1.2 pCi/L; and Category III springs are the farthest downstream and contained from 28.3±1.9 to 47.7±3.2 pCi/L.

Differences in tritium concentrations in Category I, II, and III springs are a function of the ground-water flow regimes and land uses in and hydraulically upgradient from each category of springs. A comparatively large part of the water from the Category I springs is from excess applied-irrigation water which has been diverted from the Snake River. A large part of the recharge for Category II springs originates as many as 140 miles upgradient from the springs. Tritium concentrations in Category III springs indicate that the proportion of recharge from excess applied-irrigation water is intermediate to proportions for Category I and II springs.

Tritium concentrations in precipitation and in the Snake River were relatively large in the 1950's and 1960's owing to atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons. Conversely, tritium concentrations in ground water with a residence time of several tens to a few hundred years, as occurs in the Snake River Plain aquifer hydraulically upgradient from the Category II springs, are comparatively small because of the 12.4-year half-life of tritium.

The conclusion that recharge from excess applied-irrigation water from the Snake River has affected tritium in the Snake River Plain aquifer is supported by differences in the deuterium (<sup>2</sup>H) and oxygen-18 (<sup>18</sup>O) ratios of water. These ratios indicate that water discharged by the springs is recharged by waters of different origins. Irrigation recharge is more enriched in <sup>2</sup>H and <sup>18</sup>O than the regional ground water. Water from Category I springs is more enriched in <sup>2</sup>H and <sup>18</sup>O than is water from Category II or III springs because a large proportion of irrigation recharge mixes with the regional ground water in Category I springs. Nitrite plus nitrate as nitrogen concentrations also are greater in water from Category I springs than in water from Category II springs.

Relative stable isotopic ratios for hydrogen and oxygen compared to standard mean ocean water are presented for water from 4 surface-water sites and 38 ground-water sites on or near the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL). The surface-water samples were collected monthly from March 1991 through April 1992 and after a storm event on June 18,1992. The ground-water samples either were collected during 1991 or 1992. These data were collected as part of the U.S. Geological Survey's continuing hydrogeological investigations at the INEL.

The relative isotopic ratios of hydrogen and oxygen are reported as delta <sup>2</sup>H (δ<sup>2</sup>H) and as delta <sup>18</sup>O (δ<sup>18</sup>O), respectively. The values of δ<sup>2</sup>H and δ<sup>18</sup>O in water from the four surface-water sites ranged from -143.0 to -122 and from -18.75 to -15.55, respectively. The values of 52H and 518O in water from the 38 ground-water sites ranged from -141.0 to -120.0 and from -18.55 to -14.95, respectively.

## ReedBartholomay1994

The U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Project Office at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL), in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy and Idaho State University, analyzed 66 samples from sedimentary interbed cores during a 38-month period beginning in October 1990 to determine bulk and clay mineralogy. These cores had been collected from 19 sites in the Big Lost River Basin, 2 sites in the Birch Creek Basin, and 1 site in the Mud Lake Basin, and were archived at the USGS lithologic core library at the INEL.

Mineralogy data indicate that core samples from the Big Lost River Basin have larger mean and median percentages of quartz, total feldspar, and total clay minerals, but smaller mean and median percentages of calcite than the core samples from the Birch Creek Basin. Core samples from the Mud Lake Basin have abundant quartz, total feldspar, calcite, and total clay minerals.

Water from 11 wells completed in the Snake River Plain aquifer at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory was sampled as part of the U.S. Geological Survey's quality assurance program to determine the effect of purging different borehole volumes on tritium and strontium-90 concentrations. Wells were selected for sampling on the basis of the length of time it took to purge a borehole volume of water. Samples were collected after purging one, two, and three borehole volumes. The U.S. Department of Energy's Radiological and Environmental Sciences Laboratory provided analytical services. Statistics were used to determine the reproducibility of analytical results.

The comparison between tritium and strontium-90 concentrations after purging one and three borehole volumes and two and three borehole volumes showed that all but two sample pairs with defined numbers were in statistical agreement. Results indicate that concentrations of tritium and strontium-90 are not affected measurably by the number of borehole volumes purged.

The U.S. Geological Survey and the Idaho Department of Water Resources, in response to a request from the U.S. Department of Energy, sampled 18 sites as part of a long-term project to monitor water quality of the Snake River Plain aquifer from the southern boundary of the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory to the Hagerman area. Water samples were collected and analyzed for manmade pollutants and naturally occurring constituents. The samples were collected from six irrigation wells, seven domestic wells, two springs, one stock well, one dairy well, and one observation well. Quality assurance samples also were collected and analyzed. The water samples were analyzed for selected radionuclides, inorganic constituents, organic compounds, and bacteria.

None of the samples analyzed for radionuclides, inorganic constituents, or organic compounds exceeded the established maximum contaminant levels for drinking water. Most of the radionuclide and inorganic constituent concentrations exceeded their respective reporting levels. All the samples analyzed for dissolved organic carbon had concentrations that exceeded their reporting level. Concentrations of 1,1,1-trichloroethane exceeded the reporting level in two water samples. Two samples and a quality assurance replicate contained reportable concentrations of 2, 4-D. One sample contained fecal coliform bacteria counts that exceeded established maximum contaminant levels for drinking water.

The U.S. Geological Survey, in response to a request from the U.S. Department of Energy's Pittsburgh Naval Reactors Office, Idaho Branch Office, sampled 12 wells as part of a long-term project to monitor water quality of the Snake River Plain aquifer in the vicinity of the Naval Reactors Facility, Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, Idaho. Water samples were analyzed for manmade contaminants and naturally occurring constituents. Sixty samples were collected from eight ground-water monitoring wells and four production wells. Ten quality-assurance samples also were collected and analyzed.

Most of the samples contained concentrations of total sodium and dissolved anions that exceeded reporting levels. The predominant category of nitrogen-bearing compounds was nitrite plus nitrate as nitrogen. Concentrations of total organic carbon ranged from less than 0.1 to 2.2 milligrams per liter. Total phenols in 52 of 69 samples ranged from 1 to 8 micrograms per liter. Extractable acid and base/ neutral organic compounds were detected in water from 16 of 69 samples.

Concentrations of dissolved gross alpha- and gross beta-particle radioactivity in all samples exceeded the reporting level. Radium-226 concentrations were greater than the reporting level in 63 of 68 samples.

Between 1952 and 1984, low-level radioactive waste was introduced directly into the Snake River Plain aquifer at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL), Idaho Falls, Idaho. These wastes were generated, principally, at the nuclear fuel reprocessing facility on the site. Our measurements of <sup>36</sup>Cl in monitoring and production well waters, downgradient from disposal wells and seepage ponds, found easily detectable, nonhazardous concentrations of this radionuclide from the point of injection to the INEL southern site boundary. Comparisons are made between <sup>3</sup>H and <sup>36</sup>Cl concentrations in aquifer water and the advantages of <sup>36</sup>Cl as a tracer of subsurface-water dynamics at the site are discussed.

## BusenbergOthers1993

Detectable concentrations of chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) were observed in ground water and unsaturated-zone air at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) and vicinity. The recharge ages of waters were determined to be from 4 to more than 50 years on the basis of CFC concentrations and other environmental data; most ground waters have ages of 14 to 30 years. These results indicate that young ground water was added at various locations to the older regional ground water (greater than 50 years) within and outside the INEL boundaries. The wells drilled into the Snake River Plain aquifer at INEL sampled mainly this local recharge. The Big Lost River, Birch Creek, the Little Lost River, and the Mud Lake-Terreton area appear to be major sources of recharge of the Snake River Plain aquifer at INEL.

An average recharge temperature of 9.7±1.3°C (degrees Celsius) was calculated from dissolved nitrogen and argon concentrations in the ground waters, a temperature that is similar to the mean annual soil temperature of 9°C measured at INEL. This similarity indicates that the aquifer was recharged at INEL and not at higher elevations that would have cooler soil temperatures than INEL.

Soil-gas concentrations at Test Area North (TAN) are explained by diffusion theory. The measured difference between apparent ages based on CFC-11 and CFC-12 concentrations is 7.5 years for the soil atmosphere near the water table at TAN. If ground-water recharged by slow percolation through the unsaturated zone, CFC concentrations in water would be in equilibrium with the unsaturated zone and would have apparent CFC-11 ages that are older than CFC-12 ages by a few years. Most of the ground water sampled in the vicinity of INEL indicates that the CFC-11- and CFC-12-based ages are nearly identical and not in equilibrium with the deep unsaturated-zone air. These observations indicate that the ground waters equilibrated near or within the thin soil-zone and then moved rapidly through the fractured basalts to the water table without gas-water reequilibration.

Ground waters near and southwest of the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC), the Test Reactor Area (TRA), and the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP) contain levels of CFC's that are indicative of contamination. The CFC data indicate that a large CFC-12 waste plume may originate in the vicinity of TRA. The areal extent of the CFC-12 waste plume may resemble the previously documented tritium ground-water plume; however, the CFC-12 plume seems to be larger.

Measurements at TAN show no CFC contamination of the unsaturated zone. The results are consistent with the movement of CFC's from the atmosphere into the unsaturated zone by gaseous diffusion. The measured concentration of CFC's in ambient air at this site indicate no contamination with CFC's. Air piezometers near the RWMC indicate that concentrations of CFC's are tens of times greater than those of 1991 air. Because the concentrations of CFC's increased with depth, it appears the source of the CFC's may be the 34 m and 73 m sedimentary interbeds. Calculations indicate that the flux of CFC-11 is from the unsaturated-zone atmosphere into the ground water. Anomalously high concentrations of CFC's were measured in an air sample collected at this site, which indicate a possibly significant flux of CFC's from the unsaturated zone into the atmosphere near the RWMC.

## ClevelandMullin1993

Speciation studies have indicated that plutonium and americium, with only a few exceptions, have generally low solubilities in waters from wells at the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC) at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL). The solubility of plutonium, when added in the low-oxidation-state form [Pu(in) and (IV)], did not exceed 50 percent (of the amount added) in any of the waters from wells that penetrate the Snake River Plain aquifer, and was usually much less. In water from well 92, however, which is completed in a perched aquifer at a much shallower depth than the water table, 83 percent of Pu(III) and (IV) on figure 3 remained in solution 30 days after it was added. This water, which has contacted the buried waste, contains small concentrations of organic compounds that could reduce the plutonium to the more-soluble divalent state, as well as possibly form soluble complexes. This water also has the highest concentration of carbonate (shown as alkalinity in table 1), which can form strong soluble complexes with plutonium (IV), a normally insoluble species. In experiments using the high oxidation states [Pu(V) and (VI)], virtually all the added plutonium remained in solution in the water from all wells, and remained in the relatively soluble high oxidation states. The solubility of americium was generally low in all waters, ranging from a high of 36 percent (of the amount added) to a low of 2 percent in water from well 92 after 30 days. The results indicate that although low-oxidation-state plutonium is generally insoluble in water from the Snake River Plain aquifer, it is more soluble in water from the perched aquifer and could, in time, be leached from the waste and ultimately reach the Snake River Plain aquifer.

## KnobelMann1993

Positive‐displacement piston pumps that minimize sample agitation have no apparent advantage over centrifugal submersible pumps when used to collect ground water samples for analysis of low concentrations of purge‐able organic compounds. Analytical uncertainties inherent in laboratory environments appear to influence analytical results of low‐concentration purgeable organic compound samples more than either pump type or sampling team. Centrifugal submersible pumps are at least equally efficient as positive‐displacement piston pumps in the recovery of carbon tetrachloride, 1,1,1‐trichloroethane, trichloroethylene, and chloroform after sampling and analytical influences are made constant.

## LanphereOthers1993

The petrography, age, and paleomagnetism were determined on basalt from 23 lava flows comprising about 1200 feet of core from four coreholes in the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL). The four coreholes, Well 80, NRF 89-04, NRF 89-05, and ICPP 123, are located in the southwestern part of the INEL. Paleomagnetic measurements were made on 192 samples of basalt, and K-Ar ages were measured on 19 basalt samples. All of the samples have normal magnetic polarity and were erupted during the Brunhes Normal Polarity Epoch. Basalt lava flows in ICPP 123 can be satisfactorily correlated with lava flows in the previously studied corehole at Site E, but correlations cannot be made with confidence between ICPP 123 and the other three coreholes studied in this investigation.

Analytical data for 23 trace elements are reported for ground- and surface-water samples collected at and near the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory during 1988-91. Water samples were collected from 148 wells completed in the Snake River Plain aquifer, 18 wells completed in discontinuous deep perched-water zones, and 1 well completed in an alluvial aquifer. Surface-water samples also were collected from three streams, two springs, two ponds, and one lake.

Data are categorized by concentrations of total recoverable or dissolved trace elements. Concentrations of total recoverable trace elements are reported for unfiltered water samples and include results for one or more of the following: aluminum, arsenic, barium, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, lead, manganese, mercury, nickel, selenium, silver, and zinc. Concentrations of dissolved trace elements are reported for water samples filtered through a nominal 0.45-micron filter and may also include bromide, fluoride, lithium, molybdenum, strontium, thallium, and vanadium. Concentrations of dissolved hexavalent chromium also are reported for many samples. The water samples were analyzed at the U.S. Geological Survey's National Water Quality Laboratory in Arvada, Colorado. Methods used to collect the water samples and quality assurance instituted for the sampling program are described.

Concentrations of chromium equaled or exceeded the maximum contaminant level at 12 ground-water quality monitoring wells. Other trace elements did not exceed the respective maximum contaminant levels.

A geophysical logging program was undertaken to vertically profile changes in the hydrology and hydrochemistry of the Snake River Plain aquifer that underlies the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL). Field investigations were concentrated within an area west of the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP) in three wells that penetrated the upper 190 feet of the aquifer. The logs obtained in these wells consisted of temperature, caliper, nuclear (neutron porosity and gamma-gamma density), natural gamma, borehole televiewer, gamma spectral, and thermal flowmeter (with and without pumping).

The nuclear, caliper, and televiewer logs are used to delineate individual basalt flows or flow units and to recognize breaks between flows or flow units at interflow contact zones and sedimentary interbeds. The temperature logs and flowmeter measurements obtained under ambient hydraulic head conditions identified upward fluid-circulation patterns in the three wells. Reversal of in-hole fluid-flow direction indicated hydraulic communication between well 46 and the supply well CPP2 at the ICPP. The vertical distributions of hydraulic conductivity in wells 44 and 45 were determined by measuring fluid flow in the wells concurrently with pumping. The large variations in the vertical distributions and magnitudes of hydraulic conductivity determined from these field tests testify to the complex, heterogeneous nature of the hydrogeologic system at the ICPP.

Gamma-spectral analyses performed at several depths in each well showed that the predominant source of gamma radiation in the formation at this site originates mainly from potassium (<sup>40</sup>K). However, the anthropogenic, y-emitting isotope <sup>137</sup>Cesium was detected at 32 feet below land surface in well 45.

An empirical investigation of the effect of source-receiver spacing on the response of the neutron-porosity logging tool was attempted in an effort to understand the conditions under which this tool might be applied to large-diameter boreholes in unsaturated formations. Results indicate that large spacings of 4 ft or more are required in order to effectively use the conventional porosity calibration approach for this purpose.

Statistical summaries and graphs of streamflow data were prepared for 13 gaging stations with 5 or more years of continuous record on and near the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. Statistical summaries of streamflow data for the Big and Little Lost Rivers and Birch Creek were analyzed as a requisite for a comprehensive evaluation of the potential for flooding of facilities at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory.

The type of statistical analyses performed depended on the length of streamflow record for a gaging station. Streamflow statistics generated for stations with 5 to 9 years of record were: (1) magnitudes of monthly and annual flows; (2) duration of daily mean flows; and (3) maximum, median, and minimum daily mean flows. Streamflow statistics generated for stations with 10 or more years of record were: (1) magnitudes of monthly and annual flows; (2) magnitudes and frequencies of daily low, high, instantaneous peak (flood frequency), and annual mean flows; (3) duration of daily mean flows; (4) exceedance probabilities of annual low, high, instantaneous peak, and mean annual flows; (5) maximum, median, and minimum daily mean flows; and (6) annual mean and mean annual flows.

More than 95% of the eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP) is covered by basaltic lava flows erupted in the Brunhes Normal-Polarity Chron; thus they are younger than 730 ka. About 13% of the area of the ESRP is covered by lava fields of latest Pleistocene and Holocene age <15 ka. More than 90% of the basalt volume of the ESRP is included in coalesced shield and lava-cone volcanoes made up dominantly of tube- and surface-fed pahoehoe flows. Deposits of fissure-type, tephra-cone, and hydrovolcanic eruptions constitute a minor part of the basalt volume of the ESRP.

Eight latest Pleistocene and Holocene lava fields serve as models of volcanic processes that characterize the basaltic volcanism of the ESRP. The North Robbers, South Robbers, and Kings Bowl lava fields formed in short-duration (a few days), low-volume (each <0.1 km<sup>3</sup>), fissure-controlled eruptions. The Hells Half Acre, Cerro Grande, Wapi, and Shoshone lava fields formed in long-duration (several months), high-volume (1 to 6 km<sup>3</sup>), lava cone- and shield-forming eruptions. Each of these seven lava fields represents monogenetic eruptions that were neither preceded nor followed by eruptions at the same or nearby vents. The Craters of the Moon lava field is polygenetic; about 60 flows were erupted from closely spaced vents over a period of 15,000 years.

Most of the basaltic volcanism of the ESRP is localized in volcanic rift zones, which are long, narrow belts of volcanic landforms and structures. Most volcanic rift zones are collinear continuations of basin-and-range-type, range-front faults bordering mountains that adjoin the ESRP. It is not clear whether the faults extend into the ESRP in bedrock beneath the basaltic lava flows.

The great bulk of basaltic flows in the ESRP are olivine basalts of tholeiitic and alkaline affinities. The olivine basalts are remarkably similar in chemical, mineralogical, and textural characteristics. They were derived by partial melting of the lithospheric mantle at 45 to 60 km, and they have been little affected by fractionation or contamination. Evolved magmas having Si0<sub>2</sub> contents as high as 65% occur locally in and near the ESRP. The chemical and mineralogical variability of the evolved rocks is due to crystal fractionation in the crust and to contamination by crustal minerals and partial melts of crustal rocks. The trace-element compositions of the olivine basalts and the most primitive evolved basalts do not overlap, suggesting that the evolved rocks were derived from parent magmas that are fundamentally different from the parent magmas of the olivine basalts.

The distribution and character of volcanic rift zones in the ESRP are partly controlled by underlying Neogene rhyolite calderas. Areas that lack basalt vents and have only poorly developed volcanic rift zones overlie calderas or parts of calderas filled by thick, low-density sediments and rocks, which served as density barriers to the buoyant rise of basaltic magma. Volcanic rift zones are locations of concentrated extensional strain; they define regional stress patterns in the ESRP.

Environmental tracers (chlorine-36 and tritium) were used at the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC) to estimate natural water infiltration rates in the unsaturated zone near buried nuclear waste. Cnlonne-36 and tritium were measured in the soil column to determine the depth of the maximum concentration of these radionuclides produced by atmospheric testing of nuclear devices in the late 1950's and early 1960's. Historically, the nuclear fuel reprocessing operations at the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant also have contributed to the atmospheric deposition of these radionuclides at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory.

Soil cores for analysis of chiorine-36 and tritium were taken from undisturbed soil near subsurface instrumentation (thermocouple psychrometers. tensiometers. and a neutron moisture gage) that has been used since 1985 to establish the vertical hydraulic head distribution in the unsaturated zone. erne neutron-probe access hole used is in an undisturbed soil profile adjacent to the RWMC. Rates calculated from the profiles of the environmental tracers and from the neutron-logging indicate that site-specific net infiltration to the unsaturated zone ranges from 0.36 to 1.1 cm/year. This represents 2 to 5 percent of average annual precipitation.

Ground-water samples from 76 wells and 1 hot spring at or near the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory were analyzed for 36 purgeable organic compounds during 1990-91. The samples were collected and analyzed as a continuation of a water-quality program initiated in 1987, and as part of studies conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey. Most of the wells obtain water from the Snake River Plain aquifer. Samples were collected from these wells using dedicated or portable pumps.

Water samples from 31 wells completed in the Snake River Plain aquifer contained detectable concentrations of at least 1 of 14 purgeable organic compounds. Most commonly detected were carbon tetrachloride, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, and trichloroethylene. The maximum concentrations of specific compounds in ground water were 5.0 micrograms per liter (µg/L) or less; the concentrations of most compounds were less than the reporting level of 0.2 µg/L. In addition, water from three wells contained detectable concentrations of one of two tentatively identified organic compounds, trimethylbenzene and isopropylbenzene.

Water-level data collected through 1982 are presented in previous reports. Water-level data collected from 1983 through 1990 from 137 wells are presented in this report.

Aquifer-test data of 43 single-well tests at 22 wells in perched aquifers at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory were analyzed to estimate values of transmissivity. Estimates of transmissivity for individual wells ranged from 1.0 to 15,000 feet squared per day, more than 4 orders of magnitude. These data were determined in a consistent manner and are useful for describing the distribution of transmissivity at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory.

The results of type-curve analysis of eight tests at six wells were used to verify a regression relation between specific capacity and transmissivity. This relation, in turn, was used to analyze all specific-capacity data. Values of relative uncertainty for estimated values of transmissivity generally ranged from 0.1 order of magnitude for type-curve analysis to 0.5 order of magnitude for regression analysis and measured drawdown of less than 0.1 foot. The values of transmissivity given in this report represent the transmissivity near the test wells and within the test interval. Due to the high degree of heterogeneity of the basalt and the unknown thickness of the aquifers, it is more likely the transmissivity of the whole basalt sequence is different from those values given in this report.

## Ackerman1991b

Aquifer-test data of 183 single-well tests at 94 wells in the Snake River Plain aquifer were analyzed to estimate values of transmissivity. Estimates of transmissivity for individual wells ranged from 1.1 to 7.6×l0<sup>5</sup> feet squared per day, nearly 6 orders of magnitude. These data were determined in a consistent manner and are useful for describing the distribution of transmissivity at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory.

The results of type-curve analysis of 37 tests at 26 wells were used to develop a regression relation between specific capacity and transmissivity. This relation, in turn, was used to analyze all specific-capacity data. Values of relative uncertainty for estimated values of transmissivity generally ranged from 0.1 order of magnitude for type-curve analysis to 0.5 order of magnitude for specific-capacity analysis with measured drawdown of less than 0.1 foot.

The values of transmissivity given in this report represent the transmissivity near the test wells and within the test interval. Due to the high degree of heterogeneity of the basalt and the unknown thickness of the aquifer, it is more likely the transmissivity of the whole basalt sequence is different from those values given in this report. Nevertheless, the reported transmissivities are useful, because most of the development of the aquifer at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory area is limited to the top several hundreds of feet of the aquifer where the test wells are penetrated.

A complex sequence of basalt flows and sedimentary interbeds underlies the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant and Test Reactors Area at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory in eastern Idaho. Wells drilled to a depth of 700 feet penetrate a sequence of 23 basalt-flow groups and 15 to 20 sedimentary interbeds that range in age from about 200,000 to 640,000 years. The 23 flow groups consist of about 40 separate basalt flows and flow units. Each flow group is made up of one to three petrographically similar basalt flows that erupted from related source areas during periods of less than 200 years. Sedimentary interbeds consist of fluvial, lacustrine, and eolian deposits of clay, silt, sand, and gravel that accumulated during periods of volcanic inactivity ranging from thousands to hundreds of thousands of years. Multiple flow groups and sedimentary interbeds of similar age and source form seven composite stratigraphic units with distinct upper and lower contacts. Composite units older than about 350,000 years were tilted, folded, and fractured by differential subsidence and uplift. Basalt and sediment of this sequence are unsaturated to a depth that ranges from 430 to 480 feet below land surface. Basalt and sediment in the lower part of the sequence are saturated and make up the uppermost part of the Snake River Plain aquifer. Stratigraphic relations in the lowermost part of the aquifer below a depth of 700 feet are uncertain. This undifferentiated sequence of basalt and sediment is penetrated by only 17 of the 79 wells in the area and has not been evaluated for stratigraphic properties because of insufficient data. Only one well may penetrate the effective base of the aquifer at a depth of 1,200 feet below land surface.

The areal extent of basalt-flow groups and sedimentary interbeds in the upper 700 feet of the unsaturated zone and aquifer was determined from geophysical logs, lithologic logs, and well cores. Basalt flows in the cores were evaluated for potassium-argon ages, palleomagnetic properties, and petrographic characteristics. Stratigraphic control was provided by a sequence of basalt flows with reversed paleomagnetic polarity and high emission of natural-gamma radiation compared to other flows; the control was supplemented by distinct changes in natural-gamma radiation across the contacts of each of the seven composite stratigraphic units. Natural-gamma logs were used as a primary tool for Stratigraphic correlations. Natural-gamma emissions generally are uniform in related, petrographically similar basalt flows and generally increase or decrease between petrographically dissimilar flows of different age and source.

Wastewater containing radiochemical and chemical constituents has been discharged since 1952 to infiltration ponds and wells at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. Perched ground-water zones have formed from waste-water discharged to infiltration ponds. Lithologic features controlling formation of these zones include contrasts in vertical hydraulic conductivity, baked-zone alterations, unfractured basalt, and fracture filling. Waste-disposal practices, waste volumes discharged, sorption, and radioactive decay have affected concentrations of selected constituents in perched ground water.

From October 1985 to November 1988, maximum tritium concentrations in water from deep perched zones at the Test Reactors Area decreased from 1,770±30 to 948±14 picocuries per milliliter; total dissolved chromium concentrations were 190±10 and 170±20 micrograms per liter, respectively. Maximum sodium and chloride concentrations were 840±84 and 64±6 milligrams per liter in October 1985, respectively; maximum concentrations in November 1988 were 1,000±100 and 66±7 milligrams per liter, respectively. Chromium-51, cobalt-60, and cesium-137 were not detected.

Maximum tritium concentrations in water from shallow perched zones at the Test Reactors Area decreased from 5, 630±20 picocuries per milliliter during 1982-85 to 3,430±50 picocuries per milliliter during 1986-88; maximum chromium-51 concentrations increased from 28±3 to 90±3 picocuries per milliliter; maximum cobalt-60 concentrations were 11.9±0.5 and 12.5±0.4 picocuries per milliliter; and maximum cesium-137 concentrations were 2.9±0.2 and 2.48±0.16 picocuries per milliliter. Maximum total dissolved chromium concentrations were 90±10 micrograms per liter during 1982-85 and 80±10 micrograms per liter during 1986-88; maximum sodium concentrations decreased from 42±4 to 19±2 milligrams per liter.

In 1988, maximum tritium and strontium-90 concentrations in water from perched zones beneath infiltration ponds at the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant were 36.7±0.8 picocuries per milliliter and 18±2 picocuries per liter, respectively. The maximum sodium and chloride concentrations were 120±12 and 220±20 milligrams per liter, respectively.

The U.S. Geological Survey Modular Ground-Water Flow Model, commonly referred to as MODFLOW, simulates ground-water flow through porous media using the finite-difference method. The region being modeled is divided into a grid of cells, and each cell is defined to be either no-flow, variable-head, or constant-head. The model calculates a value for head at all variable-head cells whereas head at constant-head cells is specified by the user. Cells are designated as no-flow cells if they contain impermeable material or are unsaturated, and accordingly the flow of water is not simulated in such cells.

As originally published, MODFLOW could simulate the desaturation of variable-head model cells, which resulted in their conversion to no-flow cells, but could not simulate the resaturation of cells. That is, a no-flow cell could not be converted to variable head. However, such conversion is desirable in many situations. For example, one might wish to simulate pumping that desaturates some cells followed by the recovery of water levels after pumping is stopped. An option that allows cells to convert from no-flow to variable-head has been added to the model. In this option, a cell is converted to variable head based on the head at neighboring cells. The option is written in FORTRAN 77 and is fully compatible with the existing model. This report documents the new option, including a description of the concepts, detailed input instructions, and a listing of the code. Example problems illustrate the practical applications of the option. Although solution of the modified flow equations can be difficult for the model solvers, the example problems show that it is possible to solve a variety of complex problems.

Detectable concentrations of radionuclide- and chemical-waste constituents In water from the Snake River Plain aquifer at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory decreased during 1986-88. Decreased radionuclide concentrations are attributed to reduced rates of radionuclide-waste disposal, sorption processes, radioactive decay, dilution from recharge, and changes in waste-disposal practices.

Tritium concentrations in aquifer water decreased as much as 39 pCi/mL (picocuries per milliliter) during 1986-88 and ranged from 0.7±0.2 to 61.6±1.1 pCi/mL In 1988. Strontium-90 concentrations decreased as much as 33 pCi/L (picocuries per liter) during 1986-88 and ranged from 8±2 to 48±3 pCi/L In 1988. Cobalt-60 and cesium-137 concentrations exceeded the reporting level In water from only one well during 1986-88.

In 1988, concentrations of plutonlum-238 and plutonlum-239, -240 (undivided) in water from the Test Area North disposal well were 0.19±0.05 pCi/L and 0.96±0.08 pCl/L, respectively. The concentration of plutonlum-238 in well CFA-1 was 0.11±0.03 pCi/L in 1987. In subsequent samples, concentrations were less than the reporting level.

Sodium, chloride, and nitrate plumes originating from the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant decreased in size since use of the ICPP disposal well was discontinued in 1984. During 1986-88, the approximate areal extent of the sodium plume decreased from 6.8 to 2.5 square miles, the chloride plume decreased from 17 to 5.2 square miles, and the nitrate plume decreased from 14 to 5 square miles. In 1987, water from wells 65 and 89 contained 280 and 50 µg/L, respectively, of chromium; other water samples contained from less than 1 to 30 µg/L.

## OrrOthers1991

Background concentrations of radionuclides, organic compounds, and inorganic chemical constituents in water in the Snake River Plain aquifer were estimated from ground-water sample analyses. Detectable concentrations of transuranic elements should not be present in water from the Snake River Plain aquifer. Background concentrations of tritium generally range from 75 to 150 pCi/L (picocuries per liter). Strontium-90 and iodine-129 concentrations generally are 0 and from 0 to 0.05 pCi/L, respectively. At the INEL (Idaho National Engineering Laboratory), comparison of the mean and median concentrations of tritium, strontium-90, and iodine-129 indicates that operations locally have affected concentrations in ground water.

Gross alpha-particle and beta-particle radioactivity in water from the Snake River Plain aquifer range from 0 to 5 pCi/L and 0 to 8 pCi/L, respectively. Background gamma radiation in ground water is attributed to cesium-137, cobalt-60, and potassium-40. Ground water at the INEL generally contains no cesium-137 or cobalt-60. Naturally occurring concentrations of potassium-40 probably are about 300 pCi/L.

Background concentrations of organic compounds in water from the Snake River Plain aquifer generally are less than 0.2 µg/L (micrograms per liter). Background arsenic and chromium concentrations both range are 2 to 3 µg/L. Barium concentrations range from about 50 to about 70 µg/L. Lead and mercury concentrations generally are less than 5 µg/L and 0.1 µg/L, respectively. Cadmium, selenium, and silver concentrations generally are less than 1 µg/L. Nitrate concentrations range from 0 to about 1.4 mg/L (milligrams per liter).

## WegnerCampbell1991

The U.S. Geological Survey and the Idaho Department of Water Resources, in response to a request from the U.S. Department of Energy, have completed the initial phase of a long-term project to monitor the quality of water in the Snake River Plain aquifer from the southern boundary of the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory to the Hagerman area, Idaho. Fifty-five water samples were collected and analyzed for manmade pollutants and naturally occurring contaminants. The samples were collected from 26 irrigation wells, 13 domestic wells, 5 springs, 4 stock wells, 3 dairy wells, 2 observation wells, 1 commercial well, and 1 public-supply well. Six quality assurance samples also were collected and analyzed. All water samples were analyzed for selected radionuclides, chemical constituents, and organic compounds.

The maximum contaminant level established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for gross alpha-particle radioactivity was exceeded in one sample; the maximum contaminant level for mercury also was exceeded in one sample. Both sampling locations are downgradient from many of the sampling locations in which gross-alpha radioactivity and mercury concentrations were less than maximum contaminant levels. Concentrations of diazinon and malathion exceeded the reporting level in two water samples. One water sample and its quality assurance replicate contained reportable concentrations of DOT.

## Bartholomay1990a

The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, digitized geophysical logs from wells at the INEL (Idaho National Engineering Laboratory) logged prior to August 1989, to make them more accessible. Geophysical well logs were digitized, processed, and stored on 5&frac14;-in. floppy disks.

The types of geophysical logs available and the number of each digitized are listed for wells on or near the INEL. Data sheets with information on the wells are presented along with selected neutron, gamma- gamma, gamma, and caliper logs.

## Bartholomay1990b

The U.S. Geological Survey's project office at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, used mineralogical data to correlate surficial sediment samples from the Big Lost River, Little Lost River, and Birch Creek drainages with selected sedimentary interbed core samples taken from test holes at the RWMC (Radioactive Waste Management Complex), TRA (Test Reactors Area), ICPP (Idaho Chemical Processing Plant), and TAN (Test Area North). Correlating the mineralogy of a particular present-day drainage area with a particular sedimentary interbed provides information on historical source of sediment for interbeds in and near the INEL.

Mineralogical data indicate that surficial sediment samples from the Big Lost River drainage contained a larger amount of feldspar and pyroxene and a smaller amount of calcite and dolomite than samples from the Little Lost River and Birch Creek drainages. Mineralogical data from sedimentary interbeds at the RWMC, TRA, and ICPP correlate with surficial sediment of the present-day Big Lost River drainage. Mineralogical data from a sedimentary interbed at TAN correlate with surficial sediment of the present-day Birch Creek drainage.

## Bartholomay1990c

Forty-three samples of surficial sediment from the Big Lost River, Little Lost River, and Birch Creek drainages were collected from July 1987 through August 1988 for analysis of grain—size distribution, mineralogy, and petrology. The sample collection and analysis was done in cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey's project office at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL). Samples were collected from channel, overbank, spreading area, playa, and sink deposits to compare source area with the characteristic surficial sediments in associated drainages in terms of their mineralogy, petrology, and grain—size distribution. Differences in sediment from the three drainages may allow for correlations to be made between the mineralogy of surficial sediments and sedimentary interbeds at the INEL.

Feldspar and pyroxene in the Big Lost River drainage and calcite and dolomite in the Little Lost River and Birch Creek drainages reflect source area petrology. Illite is the dominant clay mineral in all three drainages. Data showed that source area had little effect on grain-size distribution.

Previously published mineralogic characteristics of sedimentary interbeds from the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC) and the Test Reactors Area (TRA) —Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP) are most similar to those of surficial deposits of the modern Big Lost River drainage. More study on interbed deposits at the INEL may aid in the interpretation of past depositional patterns.

## Bennett1990

The Big Lost River flows onto the eastern Snake River Plain near Arco, Idaho, and across the INEL (Idaho National Engineering Laboratory). Most streamflow infiltrates the bed of the Big Lost River channel, INEL spreading areas A, B, C, and D, and playas located at the terminus of the river, to recharge the Snake River Plain aquifer.

Average annual streamflow during 1965-87 for the Big Lost River upstream from the INEL diversion dam was 104,400 acre-feet; 52,000 acre-feet were diverted to the INEL spreading areas, 9,800 acre-feet infiltrated between the INEL diversion dam and Lincoln Boulevard, and 42,600 acre-feet infiltrated downstream from Lincoln Boulevard or flowed to playas. Stream- flow losses to evapotranspiration were minor compared to infiltration losses.

Losses were measured in selected reaches of the 44 miles of river from Arco to playa 1 at discharges that ranged from 37 to 372 ft<sup>3</sup>/s (cubic feet per second). Infiltration losses were from 1 to 2 (ft<sup>3</sup>/s)/mi (cubic feet per second per mile) at discharges less than 100 ft<sup>3</sup>/s throughout most of the reach between measurement site 1 (near Arco) and measurement site 13 (upstream from the Big Lost River Sinks). Loss from the river in the reach between measurement site 6 (INEL diversion) and measurement site 7 ranged from 1 to 4 (ft<sup>3</sup>/s)/mi. Loss in the reach between measurement site 13 and measurement site 14 ranged from 7 to 12 (ft<sup>3</sup>/s)/mi. Discharge measurements made May 6-8, 1985, when streamflow near Arco was 372 ft<sup>3</sup>/s, indicated that channel infiltration is largest at high stages. A maximum loss of 28 (ft<sup>3</sup>/s)/mi was measured in the area of the Big Lost River Sinks. Water levels in the area immediately southwest of the Radioactive Waste Management Complex and the area between the Naval Reactors Facility and playas 1 and 2 were substantially affected by recharge from the Big Lost River.

Since 1952, radioactive waste has been buried at the RWMC (Radioactive Waste Management Complex) at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory in southeastern Idaho. In 1985, the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, began a study of the geohydrology of the RWMC to provide a basis for estimating the extent of and the potential for migration of radionuclides in the unsaturated zone beneath the waste burial trenches and pits. This study is being conducted to provide hydrological, meteorological, and geohydrological data for the test trench area adjacent to the northern boundary of the RWMC.

During 1987, data were collected from the test trench area, where several types of instrumentation were installed in the surficial sediment in 1985. Hydrological data collected from both disturbed and undisturbed soil included measurements, recorded hourly and averaged every 12 hours, of soil temperature and soil-water potential from 28 thermocouple psychrometers placed at selected depths to about 6 m. Soil-moisture content measurements were collected biweekly in nine neutron-probe access holes with a neutron moisture depth gage. One additional neutron-probe access hole was installed during November 1987 to extend the area over which soil-moisture content measurements were made.

Meteorological data collected hourly and summarized daily included incoming and emitted long-wave radiation; incoming and reflected short-wave radiation; air temperature, relative humidity, and windspeed at 1 and 2 m above land surface; wind direction; and precipitation.

To describe grain-size distribution with depth, nine samples from neutron-probe access hole 1, and eight samples from the east lysimeter area were analyzed using sieve and pipette methods. Statistical parameters, generalized carbonate content, color, particle roundness and sphericity, and mineralogic and clastic constituents were determined for each sample. Selected size fractions of some samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction techniques to determine bulk and clay mineralogy.

## EdwardsOthers1990

Reconnaissance-level sampling for selected nutrients, pesticides, and surfactants in ground water upgradient from the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory was conducted during June 1989. Water samples collected from eight irrigation wells, five domestic or livestock wells, and two irrigation canals were analyzed for nutrients, herbicides, insecticides and polychlorinated compounds, and surfactants. In addition to the above constituents, water samples from one irrigation well, one domestic well, and one irrigation canal were analyzed for arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, selenium, and silver.

Concentrations of nitrite plus nitrate as nitrogen ranged from less than the reporting level to 6.10 mg/L (milligrams per liter), and orthophosphate concentrations as phosphorus ranged from less than the reporting level to 0.070 mg/L (micrograms per liter). Concentrations of 2,4-D in two water samples were 0.01 µg/L and 0.10 µg/L. Water samples analyzed for 15 other herbicides, 10 carbamate insecticides, 11 organophosphorus insecticides, and 15 organochlorine insecticides, gross polychlorinated biphenyls, and gross polychlorinated naphthalenes all had concentrations below their reporting levels. Concentrations of surfactants ranged from 0.02 to 0.35 mg/L. Arsenic, barium, chromium, selenium, and silver concentrations exceeded reporting levels in most of the samples.

## Mann1990

Ground-water samples from 38 wells at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory were analyzed for 36 purgeable organic compounds in 1988-89. The samples were collected and analyzed as a continuation of a water-quality program initiated in 1987. Thirty-six of the wells obtain water from the Snake River Plain aquifer and were equipped with dedicated or portable pumps. Water samples from one well that obtains water from the aquifer and one that obtains water from a perched ground-water zone were collected using a thief sampler.

Analyses of water from 22 wells indicated that the aquifer locally contained detectable concentrations of at least 1 of 19 purgeable organic compounds, mainly carbon tetrachloride, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, and trichloroethylene. Except for five wells, the maximum concentration of a specific compound in ground water was 6.4 µg/L (micrograms per liter) or less; the concentrations of most compounds were less than 0.2 µg/L. Water from four wells at and near the Test Area North contained from 44 to 29,000 µg/L of trichloroethylene. Water from a well that obtains water from a discontinuous perched ground-water zone at the Radioactive Waste Management Complex contained 1,400 µg/L of carbon tetrachloride, 940 µg/L of chloroform, 250 µg/L of 1,1,1-trichloroethane, and 1,100 µg/L of trichloroethylene.

Selected purgeable organic compounds, such as total xylene and methylene chloride, were detected in some ground-water samples and some blank samples consisting of boiled deionized water. Their presence in the blank samples suggests the compounds could have been inadvertently introduced into the ground-water samples during or subsequent to collection.

## MannCecil1990

From 1952 to 1988, approximately 30,900 curies of tritium were contained in wastewater generated by the ICPP (Idaho Chemical Processing Plant) and the TRA (Test Reactor Area) at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. The wastewater at the ICPP was discharged directly to the Snake River Plain aquifer through a disposal well until February 9, 1984, when routine use of the well was discontinued and an unlined infiltration pond was put into use. A second pond was put into use on October 17, 1985. Wastewater disposed at the TRA has been discharged to one to three infiltration ponds since 1952.

The average annual concentration of tritium in water from 26 selected wells at the INEL decreased from 250 pCi/mL (picocuries per milliliter) in 1961 to 18 pCi/mL in 1988, a decrease of 93 percent. The maximum tritium concentration was 844±5 pCi/mL in 1961 and 61.6±1.1 pCi/mL in 1988. Four factors are responsible for this decrease in tritium concentration: (1) a decrease in the amount of tritium disposed annually to ponds and wells from 1961 to 1988; (2) the change from the use of a disposal well to infiltration ponds at the ICPP; (3) radioactive decay; and (4) dilution from recharge.

## MannKnobel1990

The U.S. Geological Survey, in response to a U.S. Department of Energy request, collected and analyzed water samples from 15 sites in Minidoka County, Idaho for manmade pollutants and naturally occurring contaminants. Samples were collected from 12 ground-water and 3 irrigation wastewater sites. Samples were analyzed for tritium, gross alpha- and beta-particle radioactivity, total uranium, radium, radon-222, strontium-90, gross gamma radioactivity, trace metals, purgeable organic compounds, nutrients, and pesticides.

Tritium concentrations were determined by U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Department of Energy, and Idaho State University laboratories. Seven samples had tritium concentrations larger than the reporting level, ranging from 0.045±0.013 to 0.106±0.013 pCi/mL (picocuries per milliliter). The maximum contaminant level for tritium is 20 pCi/mL. Ranges of dissolved concentrations for some other radionuclides or types of radioactivity follow: gross alpha-particle radioactivity as thorium-230--2.23±0.61 to 9.10±1.25 pCi/L (picocuries per liter); gross beta-particle radioactivity as strontium-90 in equilibrium with yttrium-90--2.50±1.28 to 10.3±2.5 pCi/L; total uranium--1.38±0.16 to 5.22±1.02 µg/L (micrograms per liter); radium-226--0.0102±0.0064 to 0.149±0.024 pCi/L; and strontium-90--from less than the reporting level to 0.483±0.071 pCi/L. The uncertainties are all given as two sample standard deviations (2s) except tritium, which is 1s.

Concentrations of nitrite plus nitrate as nitrogen ranged from 0.94 to 5 mg/L (milligrams per liter) and orthophosphate concentrations as phosphorous ranged from 0.01 to 0.12 mg/L. Tetrachloroethylene (0.2 µg/L) and benzene (0.2 µg/L) were present in water from an irrigation drain. Water from three irrigation drains contained concentrations of 2,4-D ranging from 0.02 to 0.27 µg/L. Carbofuran, fonofos, dieldrin, aldicarb, diuron, bromacil, a phenylurea-like compound, diazinon, and malathion were present in one or more water samples--mostly from the irrigation drains--at small concentrations.

## TeasdalePemberton1990

This report describes results of a suction-drilling (vacuum-drilling) experiment conducted in the basalts of the Snake River Plain at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, Idaho. This drilling technique, which uses high-pressure, high-volume air and a steam ejector-eductor siphon, requires no downhole drilling fluids to be introduced into the borehole. Consequently, it would be an excellent drilling method for use in studies of flow in the unsaturated zone, particularly in areas of suspected contamination.

Lost circulation is not a problem because the advancing borehole is always cased with the drill rod. Continuous cuttings samples are obtained using the suction-drilling method. The cuttings are dropped into a changeable jar or like receptacle in the sample-collection device. These samples can be inspected visually as drilling progresses.

## AndersonLewis1989

A complex sequence of layered basalt flows, cinders, and sediment underlies the Radioactive Waste Management Complex at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory in southeastern Idaho. Wells drilled to 700 feet penetrate a sequence of 10 basalt-flow groups and 7 major sedimentary interbeds that range in age from about 100,000 to 600,000 years old. The 10 flow groups consist of 22 separate lava flows and flow-units. Each flow group is made up of from one to five petrographically similar flows that erupted from common source areas during periods of less than 200 years. Sedimentary interbeds consist of fluvial, lacustrine, and eolian deposits of clay, silt, sand, and gravel that accumulated during periods of volcanic inactivity ranging from thousands to hundreds of thousands of years. Flows and sediment are unsaturated to a depth of about 600 feet. Flows and sediment below a depth of 600 feet are saturated and make up the uppermost part of the Snake River Plain aquifer.

The areal extent of flow groups and interbeds was determined from well cuttings, cores, geophysical logs, potassium-argon ages, and geomagnetic properties. Stratigraphic control was provided by four sequential basalt flows near the base of the unsaturated zone that have reversed geomagnetic polarity and high emission of natural gamma radiation compared to other flows. Natural gamma logs were used as a primary correlation tool. Natural-gamma emissions generally are uniform in related, petrographically similar flows and generally increase or decrease between petrographically dissimilar flows of different age and source.

## BartholomayKnobel1989

The U.S. Geological Survey's project office at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, collected 13 samples of surficial sediment from the Little Lost River and Birch Creek drainages during August 1988 for analysis of grain-size distribution, bulk mineralogy, and clay mineralogy. Samples were collected from five sites in the channel of the Little Lost River, two sites from overbank deposits of the Little Lost River, five sites in the channel of Birch Creek, and one site from an overbank deposit of Birch Creek.

Six samples from the Birch Creek channel and overbank deposits had a mean of 7.8 and median of 2.5 weight percent in the less than 0.062 millimeter fraction. The seven samples from the Little Lost River channel and overbank deposits had a mean of 34.5 and median of 23.8 weight percent for the same size fraction. Mineralogy data indicated that Birch Creek had larger mean percentages of quartz and calcite, and smaller mean percentages of total feldspar and dolomite than the Little Lost River deposits. Illite was the dominant clay mineral present in both drainages, but the Little Lost River deposits contained more smectite, mixed-layer clays, and kaolinite than the Birch Creek deposits.

## BartholomayOthers1989

The U.S. Geological Survey's project office at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, collected 35 samples of surficial sediment from the Big Lost River drainage and vicinity from July 1987 through August 1988 for analysis of grain-size distribution, bulk mineralogy, and clay mineralogy. Samples were collected from 11 sites in the channel and 5 sites in overbank deposits of the Big Lost River, 6 sites in the spreading areas that receive excess flow from the Big Lost River during peak flow conditions, 7 sites in the natural sinks and playas of the Big Lost River, 1 site in the Little Lost River Sinks, and 5 sites from other small, isolated closed basins.

Eleven samples from the Big Lost River channel deposits had a mean of 1.9 and median of 0.8 weight percent in the less than 0.062 millimeter fraction. The other 24 samples had a mean of 63.3 and median of 63.7 weight percent for the same size fraction. Mineralogy data are consistent with grain-size data. The Big Lost River channel deposits had mean and median percent mineral abundances of total clays and detrital mica of 10 and 10 percent, respectively, whereas the remaining 24 samples had mean and median values of 24 and 22.5 percent, respectively.

From 1952 to 1988, about 140 curies of strontium-90 have been discharged in liquid waste to disposal ponds and wells at the INEL (Idaho National Engineering Laboratory). The U.S. Geological Survey routinely samples ground water from the Snake River Plain aquifer and from discontinuous perched-water zones for selected radionuclides, major and minor ions, and chemical and physical characteristics. Water samples for strontium-90 analyses collected in the field are unfiltered and preserved to an approximate 2-percent solution with reagent-grade hydrochloric acid.

Water from four wells completed in the Snake River Plain aquifer was sampled as part of the U.S. Geological Survey's quality-assurance program to evaluate the effect of filtration and preservation methods on strontium-90 concentrations in ground water at the INEL. The wells were selected for sampling on the basis of historical concentrations of strontium-90 in ground water. Water from each well was filtered through either a 0.45- or a 0.1-micrometer membrane filter; unfiltered samples also were collected. Two sets of filtered and two sets of unfiltered water samples were collected at each well. One set of water samples was preserved in the field to an approximate 2-percent solution with reagent-grade hydrochloric acid and the other set of samples was not acidified.

Laboratory analytical results showed strontium-90 concentrations that ranged from below the reporting level to 52±4 picocuries per liter. Descriptive statistics were used to determine reproducibility between the analytical results for strontium-90 concentrations in water from each well. Analytical results were compared to the results from unfiltered, acidified samples at each well. Water from well 88 had strontium-90 results that were not in statistical agreement between the different filtration and preservation methods. The strontium-90 concentration for water from well 88 was below the reporting level.

For water from wells with strontium-90 concentrations at or above the reporting level, 94 percent or greater of the strontium-90 was in true solution or in colloidal particles smaller than 0.1 micrometer. These results suggest that within-laboratory reproducibility for strontium-90 in ground water at the INEL is not significantly affected by changes in filtration and preservation methods used for sample collection.

Concern has been expressed that some of the approximately 30,900 curies of tritium disposed to the Snake River Plain aquifer from 1952 to 1988 at the INEL (Idaho National Engineering Laboratory) has migrated to springs that discharge to the Snake River in the Twin Falls-Hagerman area. To document tritium concentrations in springflow, 17 springs were sampled in November 1988 and 19 springs were sampled in March 1989. Analyses showed that the tritium concentrations were less than the minimum detectable concentration of about 0.5 pCi/mL (picocuries per milliliter) in November1988 and less than the minimum detectable concentration of about 0.2 pCi/mL in March 1989; the minimum detectable concentration was smaller in March1989 owing to a longer counting time in the liquid scintillation system. For comparison, the maximum contaminant level of tritium in drinking water as established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is 20 pCi/mL.

Samples analyzed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency indicate there has been a subtle decrease in tritium concentrations in the Snake River near Buhl since the 1970's owing to the radioactive decay of tritium that was produced by atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons in the 1950's and 1960's. In 1974-79, the concentrations were less than 0.3±0.2 pCi/mL in 3 of 20 samples, whereas, in 1983-88, 17 of 23 samples contained less than 0.3±0.2 pCi/mL of tritium; the minimum detectable concentration is 0.2 pCi/mL. On the basis of these findings, aqueous waste disposal of tritium at the INEL has had no measurable effect on tritium concentrations in the springflow discharging from the Snake River Plain aquifer and in the Snake River near Buhl. This conclusion is supported by the distribution of tritium in the Snake River Plain aquifer as delineated by Pittman and others (1988, Hydrologic conditions at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, 1982 to 1985: U.S. Geological Survey Water-Resources Investigations Report 89-4008, 73 p.).

The hydrologic properties of the unsaturated zone and amount of net recharge to the system must be determined to field-calibrate a mathematical model to predict the long-term migration of radionuclides in the unsaturated zone. This study is being conducted to provide that necessary data for a specific area. Radioactive waste has been buried at the RWMC (Radioactive Waste Management Complex) at the INEL (Idaho National Engineering Laboratory) since 1952. In 1985, the U.S. Geological Survey and EG&G Idaho, Inc., in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, began a study of the geohydrology of the RWMC to provide a basis for estimating the extent of and the potential for migration of radionuclides in the unsaturated zone beneath the waste burial trenches and pits.

Two test trenches were installed in the surficial sediment adjacent to the RWMC burial ground to collect hydrologic data from undisturbed and disturbed soil. Hydrologic data collected during 1985 and 1986 included measurements, taken every 12 hours, of soil temperature and soil-water potential from 30 sensors placed at selected depths to about 6 meters using thermocouple psychrometers; and soil-moisture content measurements collected weekly in 9 neutron-probe access holes with a neutron moisture depth gage. Meteorological data averaged every 6 hours included wind speed, wind direction, relative humidity, air temperature; solar radiation and precipitation were totaled over the 6-hour period.

## Wegner1989

Multiple water samples from 115 wells and 3 surface-water sites were collected between 1980 and 1988 for the ongoing quality assurance program at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. The reported results from the six laboratories involved were analyzed for agreement using descriptive statistics. The analytical constituents and properties included: tritium, plutonium-238, plutonium-239, -240 (undivided), strontium-90, americium-241, cesium-137, total dissolved chromium, selected dissolved trace metals, sodium, chloride, nitrate, selected purgeable organic compounds, and specific conductance. Agreement could not be calculated for trace metals, some nitrates, purgeable organic compounds, and blank-sample analyses because analytical uncertainties were not consistently reported. However, differences between results for most of these data were calculated. The blank samples were not analyzed for differences. The laboratory results analyzed using descriptive statistics showed a median agreement of 95 percent between all usable data pairs.

Sampling for radionuclides in ground water was conducted at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory during September to November 1987. Water samples from 80 wells that obtain water from the Snake River Plain aquifer and 1 well that obtains water from a shallow, discontinuous perched-water body at the Radioactive Waste Management Complex were collected and analyzed for tritium, strontium-90, plutonium-238, plutonium-239, -240 (undivided), americium-241, cesium-137, cobalt-60, and potassium-40--a naturally occurring radionuclide. The ground-water samples were analyzed at the U.S. Department of Energy's Radiological and Environmental Sciences Laboratory at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory in Idaho. Methods used to collect the water samples and quality assurance instituted for the sampling program are described in detail.

Tritium and strontium-90 concentrations ranged from below the reporting level to 80.6±1.5×10<sup>-6</sup> and 193±5×10<sup>-8</sup> µCi/mL, respectively. Water from a disposal well at Test Area North which has not been used to dispose of waste water since September 1972--contained 122±9×10<sup>11</sup> µCi/mL of plutonium-238, 500±20×10<sup>-11</sup> µCi/mL of plutonium-239, -240 (undivided), 21±4×10<sup>-11</sup> µCi/mL of americium-241, and 750±20×10<sup>-8</sup> µCi/mL of cesium-137; the presence of these radionuclides was verified by resampling and reanalysis. The disposal well had 8.9±0.9×10<sup>-7</sup> µCi/mL of cobalt-60 on October 28, 1987, but cobalt-60 was not detected when the well was resampled on January 11, 1988. Potassium-40 concentrations were less than the reporting level in all wells.

## MannKnobel1988

Reconnaissance-level sampling for nine trace metals in ground water was conducted at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory during June to November 1987. Water samples from 81 wells that tap the Snake River Plain aquifer and that are equipped with dedicated pumps were collected and analyzed for arsenic, barium, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, selenium and silver; one sample from a discontinuous perched-water zone was collected with a thief sampler and analyzed for beryllium. The ground-water samples were analyzed at the U.S. Geological Survey's National Water Quality Laboratory in Arvada, Colorado. Methods used to collect the water samples and quality assurance instituted for the sampling program are described in detail.

Except for beryllium and chromium, the concentration of the trace metals in water from the 82 wells were less than their respective maximum contaminant level for drinking water established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The maximum concentration of beryllium was 0.7 µg/L (micrograms per liter) which is near the reporting level; no maximum contaminant level has been established for beryllium. The chromium concentrations in water from wells that tap the Snake River Plain aquifer ranged from less than 1 to 280 µg/L. Water from 2 of the 81 wells contained 50 µg/L or more, which is the maximum contaminant level for chromium; in water from the 30 production wells, the largest chromium concentration was 20 µg/L.

## MannOthers1988

From 1953 to 1983, an estimated 0.01 to 0.136 Ci (curies) per year of iodine-129 were contained in wastewater generated by the ICPP (Idaho Chemical Processing Plant) at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. The wastewater was directly discharged to the Snake River Plain aquifer through a deep disposal well until February 9, 1984, when use of the well was discontinued and the well was replaced by an unlined infiltration pond; a second pond was put into use on October 17, 1985. For 1984-86, the annual amount of iodine-129 in wastewater discharged to the ponds ranged from 0.0064 to 0.039 Ci.

In August 1986, iodine-129 concentrations in water from 35 wells near the ICPP ranged from less than the reporting level to 3.6±0.4 pCi/L (picocuries per liter). By comparison, in April 1977, the water from 20 wells contained a maximum of 27±1 pCi/L of iodine-129; in 1981, the maximum concentration in water from 32 wells was 41±2 pCi/L. The average concentration of iodine-129 in water from 18 wells that were sampled in 1977, 1981, and 1986 was 4.0, 6.7 and 1.3 pCi/L, respectively. The marked decrease in the iodine-129 concentrations from 1981 to 1986 was the result of three factors: (1) The amount of iodine-129 disposed annually; (2) a change from the routine use of the disposal well to the infiltration ponds; and (3) dilution of the iodine-129 in the aquifer by an increase in recharge from the Big Lost River.

## PittmanOthers1988

Aqueous chemical and radioactive wastes discharged since 1952 to unlined ponds and wells at the INEL (Idaho National Engineering Laboratory) have affected water quality in perched ground-water zones and in the Snake River Plain aquifer. Routine wastewater disposal was changed from a deep injection well to ponds at the ICPP (Idaho Chemical Processing Plant) in 1984. During 1982-85, tritium concentrations increased in perched ground- water zones under disposal ponds, but cobalt-60 concentrations decreased. In 1985, perched ground water under TRA (Test Reactor Area) disposal ponds contained up to 1,770±30 pCi/mL (picocuries per milliliter) of tritium and 0.36±0.05 pCi/mL of cobalt-60.

During 1982-85, tritium concentrations in water in the Snake River Plain aquifer decreased as much as 80 pCi/mL near the ICPP. In 1985, measurable tritium concentrations ranged from 0.9±0.3 to 93.4±2.0 pCi/mL. Tritium was detected in ground water near the southern boundary of the INEL, 9 miles south of the ICPP and TRA. Strontium-90 concentrations in ground water, up to 63±5 pCi/L (picocuries per liter) near the ICPP, generally were smaller than 1981 concentrations. Cesium-137 concentrations in ground water near the ICPP ranged from 125±14 to 237±45 pCi/L. Maximum concentrations of.3 plutonium-238 and plutonium-239, -240 (undivided) were 1.31±0.09×10<sup>-3</sup> and 1.9±0.3×10<sup>-4</sup> pCi/mL. Sodium and chloride concentrations generally decreased during 1982-85. Nitrate concentrations increased near the TRA and NRF (Naval Reactors Facility) and decreased near the ICPP.

## MannKnobel1987

Reconnaissance-level sampling for purgeable organic compounds in ground water was conducted at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory during June to November 1987. Water samples from 81 wells that tap the Snake River Plain aquifer and that are equipped with dedicated pumps were collected and analyzed for 36 purgeable organic compounds. Twelve compounds were detected in the samples, including carbon tetrachloride; 1,1,1-trichloroethane; trichloroethylene; tetrachloroethylene; and toluene. Except for one sample, the maximum concentration of purgeable organic compounds was 7.7 µg/L (micrograms per liter). One injection well used to dispose of waste water prior to 1973, however, yielded water that contained 35,000 µg/L of trichloroethylene and 22,000 µg/L of 1,2-trans-dichloroethylene.

A water sample from a discontinuous perched-water zone at the Radioactive Waste Management Complex was collected using a thief sampler. The water contained 1,200 µg/L of carbon tetrachloride, 860 µg/L of trichloroethylene, and 650 µg/L of chloroform. The ground-water samples were analyzed at the U.S. Geological Survey's National Water Quality Laboratory in Arvada, Colorado. In addition, 39 duplicate samples were analyzed at the Environmental Chemistry Laboratory operated by the U.S. Department of Energy's contractor, EG&G Idaho, Inc. Methods used to collect the water samples and quality assurance instituted for the sampling program are described in detail.

To assess the potential migration of low-level radioactive waste in the shallow subsurface it is necessary to understand the hydrogeologic and geochemical characteristics of the unsaturated zone. For this purpose, this data collection study was completed for the unsaturated zone at the Radioactive Waste Management Complex, Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, on the eastern Snake River Plain in southeastern Idaho. Geologic data were needed for input into a model of potential migration of waste that was buried in pits and trenches at the facility between the early 1950's and the early 1970's. Sample preparation and analytical techniques were required that would provide the needed information on geochemical characteristics of the unsaturated zone. Examination of core and surficial sedimentary samples provided the needed data and analytical procedures were established following an intensive literature search.

## RightmireLewis1987b

To assess the potential migration of low-level radioactive waste in the shallow subsurface, it is necessary to understand the chemical interactions that occur between solids, liquids, and gases in the unsaturated zone. For this purpose, a study on the geochemistry of the unsaturated zone at the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC), Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, on the eastern Snake River Plain in southeastern Idaho was done.

Stable isotope and chemical data suggest that the perched water observed beneath the RWMC is not due to vertical infiltration through the ground surface at the RWMC, but is due to lateral flow of water that infiltrated through the diversion ponds. It is hypothesized that the water accumulates as a perched mound on the thick, laterally continuous sedimentary interbed at a depth of 73 meters (m) and then moves about 1.5 kilometers to the northeast beneath the RWMC. Infiltrating water can move clay, silt, and sand downward through sedimentary material and open fractures, at least to the interbed at a depth of 73 m.

Oxygen isotope exchange and clay mineral alteration caused by extruded lava have been observed in the upper 0.86 m of the sedimentary interbed at; a depth of 34 m and in the upper 2.65 m of the sedimentary interbed at a depth of 73 m. An examination of the sediment-basalt interrelation shows that the flows overlying the interbed at a depth of 73 m are substantially thicker than the flows overlying the interbed at a depth of 34 m (16 to 23 m compared to 6 to 10 m). Therefore, a greater influence of residual heat on the sedimentary unit that underlie the thicker flows, and thus greater alteration, may be expected. Sedimentary material at the RWMC shows isotopic and soils evidence of at least two major climatic changes within the last 200,000 years.

## Bennett1986

Stage-discharge relations were computed for two selected cross sections of a diversion channel at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory for discharges between 2,000 and 7,200 cubic feet per second. The channel diverts water from the Big Lost River into four spreading areas where the water infiltrates into the ground or evaporates. Computed water-surface profiles, based on channel conditions in the summer of 1985, indicate that the diversion channel will carry a maximum discharge of 7,200 cubic feet per second from the Big Lost River into the first spreading area. Backwater from the spreading areas is not expected to decrease the carrying capacity of the diversion channel. An additional 2,100 cubic feet per second will pass through two low swales west of the main channel for a combined maximum diversion capacity of 9,300 cubic feet per second.

## Mann1986

A 10,365-foot deep test hole drilled at the INEL (Idaho National Engineering Laboratory) in southeastern Idaho provided hydraulic information for rock units underlying the Snake River Plain aquifer. Four aquifer tests showed that the hydraulic conductivity decreased with depth from an average of 0.03 feet per day for the interval from 1,511 to 2,206 feet below land surface to an average of 0.002 feet per day for the interval from 4,210 to 10,365 feet. In contrast, the hydraulic conductivity of the Snake River Plain aquifer ranges from 1 to 100 feet per day. The hydraulic head increased with depth; the head at depth was about 115 feet greater than that for the Snake River Plain aquifer.

Water temperature in the test hole increased from 26 °C (Celsius) at 600 feet below land surface to 146 °C at 9,985 feet. The gradient was nearly linear and averaged about 1.3 °C per one-hundred feet of depth. Water from the Snake River Plain aquifer contained 381 milligrams per liter of dissolved solids and had a calcium bicarbonate chemical composition. The dissolved solids concentration in underlying rock units ranged from 350 to 1,020 milligrams per liter and the water had a sodium bicarbonate composition.

Hydrologic data for the test hole suggest that the effective base of the Snake River Plain aquifer near the test hole is between 840 and 1,220 feet below land surface. The upward vertical movement of water into the Snake River Plain aquifer from underlying rock units could be on the order of 15,000 acre-feet per year at INEL.

The Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL), in southeastern Idaho, is a principal center for nuclear energy development for the Department of Energy (DOE) and the U.S. Nuclear Navy. Fifty-two reactors have been built at the INEL, with 15 still operable.

Extensive environmental surveillance is conducted at the INEL by DOE's Radiological Environmental Sciences Laboratory (RESL), and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), EG&G Idaho, Inc., and Westinghouse Idaho Nuclear Company (WINCO). Surveillance of waste management facilities radiation is integrated with the overall INEL Site surveillance program. Air, water, soil, biota, and environmental radiation are monitored or sampled routinely at INEL.

Results to date indicate very small or no impacts from INEL on the surrounding environment. Environmental surveillance activities are currently underway to address key environmental issues at the INEL.

The U.S. Geological Survey has maintained a project office at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) since its establishment as the National Reactor Testing Station (NRTS) in 1949. During the past 34 years of INEL operations, radionuclide and chemical wastes have been disposed of to the Snake River Plain aquifer which underlies the INEL. Some of the wastes have been disposed of to leaching ponds, ditches, or subsurface leaching fields, and evidence suggests that these wastes have migrated downward to the aquifer. Other wastes have reached the aquifer by direct injection through disposal wells.

During the period from 1949 to 1982, the Geological Survey has collected several thousand water samples from an observation-well network on the INEL. Water-quality data from these wells have allowed Geological Survey scientists to observe, temporarily locate, and predict the future locations of waste plumes in the ground water. These data have been assembled on magnetic-computer tape and are now available for comparison and evaluation of various digital ground-water solute-transport models.

This report is a listing, in tabular form, of the water-quality data available on the magnetic tape. Included are water-quality data for water-table wells on and near the INEL for the period 1949 through 1982. Maps showing the locations of the wells sampled are included, as well as a reference list of reports which interpret the data.

Since the establishment of the National Reactor Testing Station (NRTS) in 1949, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has maintained a project office in the vicinity to observe the impact of station operations on the Snake River Plain aquifer. Radionuclide and chemical wastes have been disposed of to the aquifer underlying the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) (the current designation for the former NRTS) during the past 30 years of INEL operations. Liquid wastes have been disposed of to leaching ponds, ditches, subsurface leaching fields, or disposal wells.

Between 1949 to 1982, the Geological Survey collected several thousand water samples from observation wells on the INEL. Water-quality, water level, and site-inventory data from these wells have allowed Geological Survey scientists to observe, locate, and project the future locations of waste plumes in the ground water.

## Rightmire1984

Samples of sedimentary material from interbeds between basalt flows and from fractures in the flows, taken from two drill cores at the Radioactive Waste Management Complex at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory were analyzed for 1) particle-size distribution, 2) bulk mineralogy, 3) clay mineralogy, 4) cation-exchange capacity, and 5) carbonate content. Thin sections of selected sedimentary material were made for petrographic examination. These analyses are needed for a characterization of paths and rates of movement of radionuclides transported by infiltrating water.

Preliminary interpretations indicate that 1) it may be possible to distinguish the various sedimentary interbeds on the basis of their mineralogy, 2) the presence of carbonate horizons in sedimentary interbeds may be utilized to approximate the time of exposure and the climate while the surface was exposed, and 3) the type and orientation of fracture-filling material may be utilized to determine the mechanism by which fractures were filled.

This report summarizes progress on geologic and hydrologic research related to the disposal of radioactive wastes. The research is described according to whether it is related most directly to (1) high-level and transuranic wastes, (2) low-level wastes, or (3) uranium mill tailings. Included is research applicable to the identification and geohydrologic characterization of waste-disposal sites, investigations of specific sites where wastes have been stored, and studies of regions or environments where waste-disposal sites might be located. A significant part of the activity is concerned with techniques and methods for characterizing disposal sites and studies of geologic and hydrologic processes related to the transport and (or) retention of waste radionuclides.

## BarracloughOthers1982

The Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) site covers about 890 square miles of the eastern Snake River Plain and overlies the Snake River Plain aquifer. Low concentrations of aqueous chemical and radioactive wastes have been discharged to shallow ponds and to shallow or deep wells on the site since 1952. The regional water table ranges from about 200 feet to more than 1,000 feet below land surface within the INEL boundaries. The gradient of the water table averages about 4 feet per mile to the south-southwest. During the latest period of record, 1974 through 1978, the position of the water table has shown a net decline that ranges from 0.2 foot near the northern boundary of the INEL to more than 10 feet in the central and southern parts of the site. Recharge from surface water has been minimal or non-existent during the latter part of this period.

A large body of perched ground water has formed in the basalt underlying the waste disposal ponds in the Test Reactor Area. This perched zone contains tritium, chromium-51, colbalt-60, strontium-90, and several non-radioactive ions. Tritium is the only mappable waste constituent in that portion of the Snake River Plain aquifer directly underlying this perched zone.

Low concentrations of chemical and low-level radioactive wastes enter directly into the Snake River Plain aquifer through the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP) disposal well. From 1974 through 1978, this 600-foot well was used to discharge a total of 1,861 million gallons of waste water which contained 1,697 curies of radioactivity, 95 percent of which was tritium. Tritium has been discharged to the well since 1953 and has formed the largest waste plume, about 28 square miles in area, in the regional aquifer, and minute concentrations have migrated downgradient a horizontal distance of 7.5 miles. Other waste plumes south of the ICPP contain sodium, chloride, nitrate, and the resultant specific conductance. These plumes have similar configurations and flow southward; the contaminants are in general laterally dispersed in that portion of the aquifer underlying the INEL.

Other waste plumes, containing strontium-90 and iodine-129, cover small areas near their points of discharge because strontium-90 is sorbed from solution as it moves through the aquifer and iodine-129 is discharged in very low quantities. Cesium-137 is also discharged through the well but it is strongly sorbed from solution and has never been detected in a sample of ground water at the INEL. Radionuclide plume size and concentrations therein are controlled by aquifer flow conditions, the quantity discharged, radioactive decay, sorption, dilution by dispersion, and perhaps other chemical reactions. Distributions of nonradioactive chemical wastes are subject to the same processes except for radioactive decay.

## GoldsteinWeight1982

The Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) covers about 890 square miles of the eastern Snake River Plain, in southeastern Idaho. The eastern Snake River Plain is a structural basin which has been filled with thin basaltic lava flows, rhyolitic deposits, and interbedded sediments. These rocks form an extensive ground-water reservoir known as the Snake River Plain aquifer.

Six wells were drilled and two existing wells were deepened at the INEL from 1969 through 1974. Interpretation of data from the drilling program confirms that the subsurface is dominated by basalt flows interbedded with layers of sediment, cinders, and silicic volcanic rocks.

Water levels in the wells show cyclic seasonal fluctuations of maximum water levels in winter and minimum water levels in mid-summer. Water levels in three wells near the Big Lost River respond to changes in recharge to the Snake River Plain aquifer from the Big Lost River. Measured water levels in multiple piezometers in one well indicate increasing pressure heads with depth. A marked decline in water levels in the wells since 1977 is attributed to a lack of recharge to the Snake River Plain aquifer.

## LeenheerBagby1982

In August 1980, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) started a reconnaissance survey of organic solutes in drinking water sources, ground-water monitoring wells, perched water-table monitoring wells, and in select waste streams at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL).

The survey was to be a two-phase program. In the first phase, 77 wells and four potential point sources were sampled for dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Four wells and several potential point sources of insecticides and herbicides were sampled for insecticides and herbicides. Fourteen wells and four potential organic sources were sampled for volatile and semivolatile organic compounds.

The results of the DOC analyses indicate no high level (>20 mg/L DOC) organic contamination of ground water. The only detectable insecticide or herbicide was a dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) concentration of 10 parts per trillion (0.01 µg/L) in one observation well.

The volatile and semivolatile analyses do not indicate the presence of hazardous organic contaminants in significant amounts (>10 µg/L) in the samples taken.

Due to the lack of any significant organic ground-water contamination in this reconnaissance survey, the second phase of the study, which was to follow up the first phase by additional sampling of any contaminated wells, was canceled.

## LewisGoldstein1982

Aqueous chemical and radioactive wastes discharged to shallow ponds and to shallow or deep wells on the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) since 1952 have affected the quality of the ground water in the underlying Snake River Plain aquifer. The aqueous wastes have created large and laterally dispersed concentration plumes within the aquifer. The waste plumes with the largest areal distribution are those of chloride, tritium, and with high specific conductance values. The data from eight wells drilled near the southern INEL boundary during the summer of 1980 were used to evaluate the accuracy of a predictive modeling study completed in 1973, and to simulate 1980 positions of chloride and tritium plumes. Data interpretation from the drilling program indicates that the hydrogeologic characteristics of the subsurface rocks have marked effects on the regional ground-water flow regimen and, therefore, the movement of aqueous wastes.

As expected, the waste plumes projected by the computer model for 1980, extended somewhat further downgradient than indicated by well data due to conservative worst-case assumptions in the model input and inaccurate approximations of subsequent waste discharge and aquifer recharge conditions.

Ongoing studies conducted from 1974 through 1978 have shown the perpetuation of a perched ground-water zone in the basalt underlying the waste disposal ponds at the INEL's Test Reactor Area and of several waste plumes in the regional aquifer created by deep well disposal at the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP). The perched zone contains tritium, chromium-51, cobalt-60, strontium-90, and several nonradioactive chemicals. Tritium has formed the largest waste plume south of the ICPP, and accounts for 95 percent of the total radioactivity disposed of through the ICPP disposal well. Waste plumes with similar configurations and flowpaths contain sodium, chloride, and nitrate. Strontium-90, iodine-129, and cesium-137 are also discharged through the well but they are sorbed from solution as they move through the aquifer or are discharged in very small quantities. Strontium-90 and iodine-129 have formed small waste plumes and cesium-137 is not detectable in ground-water samples. Radionuclide plume size and concentrations therein are controlled by aquifer flow conditions, the quantity discharged, radioactive decay, sorption, dilution by dispersion, and perhaps other chemical reactions. Chemical wastes are subject to the same processes except for radioactive decay.

The chief volcanic hazard at the Radioactive Waste Management Complex at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, located between Arco and Idaho Falls in southeastern Idaho, is potential inundation of the site by pahoehoe basalt lava flows erupted from vents within the surrounding topographic basin. Stratigraphic, radiometric, and paleomagnetic studies show that the waste storage site has been inundated by at least 18 lava flows and flow units erupted from 7 or more separate source vents in the last 500,000 years. The lava flows and flow units were erupted in seven groups of one to as many as five flows each.

Our data show that each eruption event that formed such a group lasted less than 200 years, that the group-forming eruption events were separated by long intervals during which no lava flows entered the area, and that the eruptions were episodic rather than periodic. The radiometric data suggest that groups of flows can be assigned to three major eruption episodes that occurred about 450,000, 225,000, and 75,000 years ago. The radiometric data also suggest that intervals between major eruption episodes are as long as 225,000 years and as short as 150,000 years, and that the last eruption episode that produced lava flows that covered the storage site occurred about 75,000 years ago. Approximately one in every five volcanic eruptions within the topographic basin in about the last 200,000 years has produced lava flows that eventually reached the Radioactive Waste Management Complex site.

INEL Geothermal Exiloratory well one (INEL-I) was drilled in search of a geothermal resource beneath the Snake River Plain for use at the Chemical Processing Plant (CPP) on the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory Site. The drilling site was selected as the most promising location within reasonable distance of the CPP. The resource was thought to be located at a depth near 7500 ft (2300 m). Neither significant production nor high temperatures were noted at that depth, and the well was then drilled to 10,333 ft (3130 m) with similar findings. Rock cores, geophysical logs, and hydrologic tests of the well to date indicate that no useful geothermal resource exists at this location. Information is presented on the drilling, completion, and testing of INEL-1.

## Ackermann1979

Approximately 33 ka of seismic-refraction profiling was done near the northwest edge of the eastern Snake River Plain at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Arco, Idaho, as part of an exploration effort for sitting an exploratory geothermal well. Individual seismic spreads consisted of 24 seismometers and were 2.76 km long. Each spread was recorded by four shotpoints offset between 5 and 11 km from the ends, in addition to some closer shotpoints for shallow velocity control.

A 3.159-m-deep well was drilled 10 km from the mountain front at a location where the refraction interpretations indicate a displacement and lower velocity of the seismic basement horizon. Well cuttings and cores obtained at widely spaced intervals show that the upper 745 m consists mostly of basalt flows underlain principally by hydrothermally altered rhyolitic welded ash-flow tuffs. Hydrothermally altered rhyodacite was cored at 2,728-m depth, but the depth marking the transition from welded tuffs to rhyodacite was not determined from the cuttings. The sonic log shows no distinct breaks below the 1,080-m depth, but instead a more-or-less gradual velocity increase from 4.2 km/sec to a value of 5.3 km/sec at 2,500-m depth. The refraction interpretations are consistent with this model. In addition they show that from the mountain front a 5.2 to 6.0 km/sec horizon (limestone) plunges at approximately 30° into the Plain to a depth of 2,500 to 3,000 m. The location of the lateral transition from limestone to dense volcanic rocks could not be determined.

## DohertyOthers1979

A 10,365 ft (3,159 m) geothermal test well was drilled in the spring of 1979 at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, eastern Snake River Plain, Idaho. The majority of rock types encountered in the borehole are of volcanic origin. An upper section above 2,445 ft (745 m) consists of basaltic lava flows and interbedded sediments of alluvial, lacustrine, and volcanic origin. A lower section below 2,445 ft (745 m) consists exclusively of rhyolitic welded ash-flow tuffs, air-fall ash deposits, nonwelded ash-flow tuffs, and volcaniclastic sediments. The lithology and thickness of the rhyolitic rocks suggest that they are part of an intracaldera fill.

## DruffelOthers1979

Mackay Dam is an irrigation reservoir on the Big Lost River, Idaho, approximately 7.2 kilometers northwest of Mackay, Idaho. Consequences of possible rupture of the dam have long concerned the residents of the river valley. The presence of reactors and of a management complex for nuclear wastes on the reservation of the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL), near the river, give additional cause for concern over the consequences of a rupture of Mackay Dam.

The objective of this report is to calculate and route the flood wave resulting from the hypothetical failure of Mackay Dam downstream to the INEL. Both a full and a 50 percent partial breach of this dam are investigated. Two techniques are used to develop the dam-break model. The method of characteristics is used to propagate the shock wave after the dam fails. The linear implicit finite-difference solution is used to route the flood wave after the shock wave has dissipated.

The time of travel of the flood wave, duration of flooding, and magnitude of the flood are determined for eight selected sites from Mackay Dam, Idaho, through the INEL diversion. At 4.2 kilometers above the INEL diversion, peak discharges of 1,502 and 1,275 cubic meters per second and peak flood elevations of 1,550.3 and 1,550.2 meters were calculated for the full and partial breach, respectively. Flood discharges and flood peaks were not compared for the area downstream of the diversion because of the lack of detailed flood plain geometry.

## Barraclough1978

Low-level, liquid radioactive waste has been discharged to the Snake River Plain aquifer, at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory site, since 1953. The waste, injected through a 183-m disposal well at a nuclear-reactor fuel reprocessing facility, contains constituents that include tritium, strontium-90, cesium-137, iodine-129, heat, sodium, and chloride. Plumes of several waste components have been monitored and mapped periodically from as early as 1958. Tritium has been dispersed over an area of about 72 km<sup>2</sup> of the aquifer and has migrated about 12 km downgradient. The strontium-90 plume is about 4 km<sup>2</sup> in area and extends about 2.4 km from the discharge site. Cesium-137 has not been detected in the aquifer; It may have been immobilized by ion exchange. A thermal plume covers about 5 km<sup>2</sup> of the aquifer, and chloride and sodium plumes cover about 39 km<sup>2</sup> of the aquifer. Iodine-129 has only recently been discovered and mapped as a waste fission product at INEL. Because of its very long half-life (1.6×10<sup>7</sup> yrs), it is highly significant in long-range studies of radioactive-waste management related to nuclear-power development. Iodine-129 is dispersed over about 8 km<sup>2</sup> of the aquifer and has migrated about 4 km down-gradient from the discharge site. These waste products are in low concentrations relative to drinking water standards. This study has produced one of the most extensive field data bases available for documenting and analyzing solute-migration phenomena in ground water, and it has been useful in the development and application of numerical solute-transport modeling techniques.

## KuntzKork1978

The Arco-Big Southern Butte area of the eastern Snake River Plain, Idaho, includes a volcanic rift zone and more than 70 Holocene and late Quaternary basalt volcanoes. The Arco volcanic rift zone extends southeast for 50 km from Arco to about 10 km southeast of Big Southern Butte. The rift zone is the locus of extensional faults, graben, fissure basaltic volcanic vents, several rhyolite domes at Big Southern Butte, and a ferrolatite volcano at Cedar Butte. Limited radiometric age data and geological field criteria suggest that all volcanism in the area is younger than 700,000 years; at least 67 separate basaltic eruptions are estimated to have occurred within the last 200,000 years. The average volcanic recurrence interval for the Arco-Big Southern Butte area is approximately one eruption per 3,000 years.

Radioactive waste storage and reactor facilities at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory may be subject to potential volcanic hazards. The geologic history and inferred past volcanic events in the Arco-Big Southern Butte area provide a basis for assessing the volcanic hazard. It is recommended that a radiometric age-dating study be performed on rocks in cored drill holes to provide a more precise estimate of the eruption recurrence interval for the region surrounding and including the Radioactive Waste Management Complex. It is also recommended that several geophysical monitoring systems (dry tilt and seismic) be installed to provide adequate warning of future volcanic eruptions.

## NavarroOthers1977

The Las Vegas field group of the U.S. Geological survey installed and has maintained a tripartite seismograph network on and near the Idaho National Laboratory (INEEL) since October 1972. During a 20-month period from November 1, 1974 through June 30, 1976, no seismic activity is interpreted to have occurred on the INEL site. A total of 8161 events were recorded during the report period. Sixteen events of magnitudes between 1.1 and 2.4 (M/sub L/) occurred within the area of special study. The nearest seismic activity to the INEL was located in the vicinity of Howe, Idaho, approximately 5 km northwest of the northwest boundary of the INEL.

## BarracloughJensen1976

This report describes the influence of liquid radioactive and chemical waste disposal on the Snake River Plain aquifer at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL). This report follows the period summarized by a report by Robertson, Schoen, and Barraclough (1974) which discussed the influences of waste disposal at the INEL from 1952 to 1970.

The chemical quality of the ground water in the Snake River Plain aquifer is the primary concern. Ground-water samples were collected to determine the migration and the concentration of radioactive wastes in the subsurface. In 1971 to 1973, an average of 237 water samples was collected annually, and an average of 600 chemical and radiometric determinations was made annually. An annual average of 817 water-level measurements was made in wells to determine the relations of water-level fluctuations to the movement of wastes. Water-level fluctuations within both the regional and perched water systems were monitored and mapped.

The altitude of the regional water table at the INEL ranges from about 4,584 feet (1,400 meters) above sea level in the north to about 4,419 feet (1,350 meters) near the southwest. The average water table gradient is about 5 feet per mile (1 meter per kilometer) to the south-southwest. Within the INEL boundaries, the depth below the land surface to the regional water table ranges from 200 feet (61 meters) in the northeast to 900 feet (275 meters) in the southwest. From July 1962 to July 1972, the net changes of ground-water levels ranged from zero to a 16-foot (5 meter) rise. In the northern part of the INEL, the water levels remained relatively constant, exhibiting only a slight rise.

The Big Lost River brings considerable surface water onto the INEL during wet years. Recharge to the Snake River Plain aquifer from this flow has been significant. The average flow of the Big Lost River from 1965 through 1973 has been the highest for the period of record. The four years with the highest annual discharge occurred in 1965, 1969, 1967, and 1971, in order of decreasing discharge. High and low discharge cycles of the Big Lost River are outlined.

Recharge from the Big Lost River and other streams to the north of the INEL caused the water table in the aquifer to rise to record highs in 1972 or 1973 over much of the INEL. The water level in one well rose 21.5 feet (6.5 meters) from 1964 to 1972. This is the largest fluctuation of the water level in the Snake River Plain aquifer that has been observed at the INEL.

The 25 INEL production wells pumped an annual total of 2.5 billion gallons of water during 197 1 to 1973 (9.5×10<sup>9</sup> liters) or an average of 7 million gallons (2.6×10<sup>7</sup> liters) per day. About 50% of this pumpage was returned to the aquifer.

The Test Reactor Area utilizes ponds and a deep well to dispose of about 400 million gallons (1.5×10<sup>10</sup> liters) of dilute wastes per year. About half of the liquid waste is discharged to a radioactive waste pond. Infiltration from the ponds has formed a large perched-water body in the basalt. The perched ground-water body contains tritium, chromium-51, cobalt-60, and strontium-90. The extent and concentration of these radionuclides are shown on maps in the report.

The Idaho chemical Processing Plant (ICPP) discharges low-level radioactive waste and chemical waste directly to the Snake River Plain aquifer through a 600-foot (180 meter) disposal well. Most of the radioactivity is removed by distillation and ion exchange prior to being discharged into the well. During 1971 to 1973, the well was used to dispose of 404 curies of radioactivity, of which 389 curies were tritium (96%). The average yearly discharge was about 300 million gallons 1.1×10<sup>9</sup> liters).

The distribution of waste products in the Snake River Plain aquifer covers about 15 square miles (30 square kilometers). Since disposal began in 1952, the wastes have migrated about 5 miles (8 kilometers) downgradient from discharge points.

Radionuclides are subject to radioactive decay, sorption, and dilution by dispersion in the aquifer. Chemical wastes are subject to sorption and dilution by dispersion. Waste plumes south of the ICPP containing tritium, sodium, and chloride have been mapped and all cover a similar area. The plumes follow generally southerly flow lines and are widely dispersed in the aquifer.

The waste plume of strontium-90 covers a much smaller area of the aquifer, about 1.5 square miles (4 square kilometers). Based on the relatively small size of the plume, it would appear that the strontium-90 is sorbed from solution as it moves through the Snake River Plain aquifer.

## BarracloughOthers1976

A study was made 1970-1974 to evaluate the geohydrologic and geochemical controls on subsurface migration of radionuclides from pits and trenches in the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) solid waste burial ground and to determine the existence and extent of radionuclide migration from the burial ground. A total of about 1,700 sediment, rock, and water samples were collected from 10 observation wells drilled in and near the burial ground of Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, formerly the National Reactor Testing Station (NRTS).

Within the burial ground area, the subsurface rocks are composed principally of basalt. Wind- and water-deposited sediments occur at the surface and in beds between the thicker basalt zones. Two principal sediment beds occur at about 110 feet (34 meters) and 240 feet (73 meters) below the land surface. The average thickness of the surficial sedimentary layer is about 15 feet (4.6 meters) while that of the two principal subsurface layers is 13 and 14 feet (4.0 and 4.3 meters), respectively. The water table in the aquifer beneath the burial ground is at a depth of about 580 feet (177 meters).

Fission, activation, and transuranic elements were detected in some of the samples from the 110- and 240-foot (34- and 73 meter) sedimentary layers. Although some of the observed concentrations might be the result of statistical variance or artificial sample contamination, some migration of nuclides from the burial ground has apparently resulted from infiltration of precipitation and runoff water which, on occasion, flooded burial ground pits and trenches.

## Robertson1976

Aqueous chemical and low-level radioactive effluents have been disposed to seepage ponds since 1952 at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. The solutions percolate toward the Snake River Plain aquifer (135 m below) through interlayered basalts and unconsolidated sediments and an extensive zone of ground water perched on a sedimentary layer about 40 m beneath the ponds. A three-segment numerical model was developed to simulate the system, including effects of convection, hydrodynamic dispersion, radioactive decay, and adsorption. Simulated hydraulics and solute migration patterns for all segments agree adequately with the available field data. The model can be used to project subsurface distributions of waste solutes under a variety of assumed conditions for the future. Although chloride and tritium reached the aquifer several years ago, the model analysis suggests that the more easily sorbed solutes, such as cesium-137 and strontium-90, would not reach the aquifer in detectable concentrations within 150 years for the conditions assumed.

## NaceOthers1975

The Geologic framework of the NRTS (National Reactor Testing Station), Idaho, controls the amount and availability of the water supply, the methods and efficiency of obtaining water, and the behavior of waste materials that are disposed of on the ground and beneath the land surface. This framework also affects the selection of construction sites and the operation of reactors and other facilities.

The NRTS is at the central-northern edge of the semiarid Snake River Plain in southern Idaho, adjacent to the southern foothills of the Lemhi and Lost River Ranges. The plain was formed during the Cenozoic Era. It was formed by large scale crustal deformation in southern Idaho and by several associated episodes of volcanic activity.

The Snake River Plain commonly has been characterized as a great structural down warp, modified by a complex system of block faulting. Actually, the plain is essentially a graben, downfaulted between horst blocks represented by mountains to the north and south. The depth through Cenozoic volcanic rocks and sediments to the basement floor is not known, but it has been estimated to range from 2,000 to 20,000 feet in the central part of the plain.

Rock units of sedimentary and igneous origin, Paleozoic and Cenozoic in age, crop out in the station area. No rock units of Mesozoic age are represented in outcrop. The known geologic materials underlying the station are volcanic rocks interbedded with alluvial sediments of Pleistocene and Holocene age. These in turn are underlain by basement rocks which are probably composed of an older sequence of igneous and sedimentary rocks.

The oldest rocks exposed on the NRTS are Paleozoic in age and consist chiefly of dark-gray to gray sandy limestone with chert nodules. Small amounts of siltstone, sandstone, and conglomerate may be present.

Volcanic rocks of Tertiary age crop out at the station and range in composition from basic to silicic. These volcanic rocks consist chiefly of welded rhyolitic tuff and silicic to basic flow rocks. Locally, beds of white to light-gray compact volcanic ash rest unconformably on Paleozoic limestone. Basalt of Tertiary age is relatively rare.

Basalt of the Snake River Group of Quaternary age is exposed in about three-fourths of the station area. The basalt, typically gray to black, bluish-black, brown and brick red, ranges from dense to porous and highly vesicular. It occurs in relatively thin interlocking flows; most of the flows are the relatively smooth ropy type (pahoehoe), but a few flows are blocky basalt (aa). Beds of cinders, scoria, and basaltic glass occur locally. Although basalt is the chief rock type of the Snake River Group, the unit also includes interflow beds of windblown, lacustrine, and alluvial sediments. A younger black basalt of Holocene age which consists of a single flow occurs locally in the station and seems to be lithologically similar to flows in the Craters of the Moon National Monument.

Petrographic study, megascopic examination, and chemical analyses of 14 representative specimens of these basalts indicate that in color, fabric, density, and other megascopic properties the basalt is diverse, but in mineral and chemical composition it is remarkably uniform.

Basalt flows have individual and internal structures which consist of layering, partings, joints and other fractures, and also various types of natural voids. These structures strongly affect their capacity to store and transmit water and determine their suitability for structural foundations.

Unconsolidated sediments of Quaternary age cover large areas of the station and also are present as interflow beds in the Snake River Group. Unconsolidated materials, chiefly of Holocene age, consist largely of windblown deposits, playa deposits, slopewash, alluvium of Big Lost River and Birch Creek, alluvial fan deposits, and lake beds and associated beach and bar deposits. Some older unconsolidated deposits of undifferentiated origin are of Pleistocene age. At many places in the station the various types of unconsolidated deposits are intermixed, interfingered, and interbedded so that it is difficult to classify them into separate mappable units. This report contains information on particle-size composition, chemical composition, and mineral composition of selected samples of these sediments.

Special geologic factors of the earth materials were studied in relation to movement of fluids in the physical environment of the station. These included ion-exchange capacity of sediments and basalts, and the origin, distribution, and physical characteristics of large desiccation cracks in fine-grained sediments.

Study of the subsurface geology of the NRTS was limited to rock units about which direct evidence was available from test drilling and other subsurface exploration techniques, including electrical-resistivity and seismic surveying and radioactivity logging of wells. Rock units present include basalt of the Snake River Group, alluvium of Big Lost River and Birch Creek, Terreton Lake beds, and interflow sediments.

Detailed factors of the geologic framework that would directly influence site selection, engineering design and construction, and operation of reactors were studied chiefly at specific localities on the station. These factors included the behavior of earth materials during drilling, the availability of raw materials for construction, and the stability of earth materials in excavations---under stress and under a range in moisture conditions.

The Snake River Plain, including the NRTS, is subject to occasional seismic tremors; the oldest recorded shock occurred in 1884. Sixteen earthquakes in Idaho with an epicenter rating of V or more on the Rossi-Forel scale were recorded during the period 1894-1945. Epicenters of these quakes were more than 100 miles distant from the station.

Relatively recent volcanism has occurred in Craters of the Moon National Monument and in at least one place adjacent to the southwestern part of the NRTS. Recent activity has occurred at several other places on the Snake River Plain, such as at Hells Half Acre to the east. There is no assurance that cessation of volcanic activity in the plain is permanent. However, inasmuch as inactivity has endured for at least 100 years---longer than is ordinary for areas of active volcanism---renewal of activity seems unlikely.

## Robertson1974a

Recently developed numerical techniques have been adapted to the solution of transient radioactive solute migration problems in groundwater. The differential equations of groundwater movement are first solved by standard finite difference methods, then the differential equations of solute transport are solved by the method of characteristics. Validity of the simulation techniques is demonstrated for real examples of tritium, chloride and <sup>90</sup>Sr migration in groundwater at the National Reactor Testing Station, Idaho. This is probably the first documented field-verification of such a model that includes the effects of convective transport, two-dimensional dispersion, radioactive decay and ion exchange. Model results demonstrate the relative sensitivity of groundwater transport systems to various parameters, such as dispersion coefficients and ion-exchange distribution coefficients. The models can be very useful in predicting the behavior of natural isotopes, artificial tracers or waste in groundwater. The models allow variable hydraulic parameters in space and time, as well as variable chemical parameters. Predictive use of such models is demonstrated for several different conditions in a heterogeneous basaltic aquifer. Thirty-year predictions of tritium and <sup>90</sup>Sr migrations are shown with variable hydraulic and chemical influences. Additional methods and potential applications of modelling are suggested, including tracer migration studies and natural isotope distributions in groundwater.

## Robertson1974b

Industrial and low-level radioactive liquid wastes at the National Reactor Testing Station (NRTS) in Idaho have been disposed to the Snake River Plain aquifer since 1952. Monitoring studies have indicated that tritium and chloride have dispersed over a 15-square mile (39-square kilometer) area of the aquifer in low but detectable concentrations and have only migrated as far as 5 miles (8 kilometers) downgradient from discharge points. The movement of cationic waste solutes, particularly <sup>90</sup>Sr and <sup>137</sup>Cs, has been significantly retarded due to sorption phenomena, principally ion exchange. <sup>137</sup>Cs has shown no detectable migration in the aquifer and <sup>90</sup>Sr has migrated only about 1.5 miles (2 kilometers) from the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP) discharge well, and is detectable over an area of only 1.5 square miles (4 square kilometers) of the aquifer.

Digital modeling techniques have been applied successfully to the analysis of the complex waste-transport system by utilizing numerical solution of the coupled equations of groundwater motion and mass transport. The model includes the effects of convective transport, flow divergence, two-dimensional hydraulic dispersion, radioactive decay, and reversible linear sorption. The hydraulic phase of the model uses the iterative, alternating direction, implicit finite-difference scheme to solve the groundwater flow equations, while the waste-transport phase uses a modified method of characteristics to solve the solute transport equations simulated by the model. The modeling results indicate that hydraulic dispersion (especially transverse) is a much more significant influence than previously suggested by earlier studies. The model has been used to estimate future waste migration patterns for varied assumed hydrological and waste conditions up through the year 2000. The hydraulic effects of recharge from the Big Lost River have an important (but not predominant) influence on the simulated future migration patterns. For the assumed conditions, the model indicates that detectable concentrations of waste chloride and tritium could move as much as 15 miles (24 kilometers) downgradient from the original discharge points by the year 2000. However, the model shows <sup>90</sup>Sr moving only 2 to 3 miles (3 to 5 kilometers) downgradient in the same time. The model may also be used to estimate the effects of the various future waste disposal practices and hydrologic conditions on subsequent migration of waste products.

## RobertsonOthers1974

This report describes studies at the National Reactor Testing Station (NRTS), Idaho by the U.S. Geological Survey, which were sponsored by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. It presents a summarized evaluation of the geology, hydrology, and water geochemistry of the NRTS and the associated influences of subsurface liquid-waste products discharged from the NRTS facilities. The progressive buildup, distribution, and changes of both radioactive and chemical wastes are analyzed for the total disposal period -- 1952-70. Of principal concern is the fate of wastes discharged from the NRTS in the Snake River Plain aquifer, an extremely large and productive groundwater system underlying the vast eastern Snake River Plain.

A review of the available evidence for the geologic formation and structure of the plain indicates that it is most likely a large graben structure with several thousand feet of displacement, filled with a thick sequence of basalt flows and interbedded sediments. In some areas (Twin and Big Southern Buttes) silicic volcanism has been important. The formation of the plain and associated volcanism began about 7 million years ago (Pliocene time) and has continued to recent time, no more than 1,600 years ago. These conclusions are supported by new geochemical data gathered from thermal springs around the fringes of the plain.

Runoff from the mountainous fringes of the plain (such as the Big Lost River) recharges groundwater in the Snake River Plain aquifer, which flows southwestward toward the American Falls and Hagerman Valley areas of discharge into the Snake River. Groundwater beneath the NRTS is of exceptionally good quality with low dissolved solids (generally about 250 milligrams per liter) due to the abundant precipitative recharge in surrounding mountains, the high permeability of the aquifer and short residence time of most groundwater, the relative inertness of the basaltic matrix, and the mildly alkaline composition of recharge to the aquifer. The composition of the groundwater generally reflects the composition of rocks in the surrounding mountains and valleys rather than the composition of Snake River Plain basalts. Deep groundwater beneath the NRTS contains appreciably greater amounts of sodium, fluoride, and silica than shallow groundwater and is inferred to reflect the presence of silicic volcanic rock beneath the basalts and sediments of the Plain as well as longer groundwater residence periods. Irrigation recharge water can be readily distinguished from ordinary groundwater by its higher content of dissolved solids, higher nitrate, and warmer temperature. Due to the near-saturation of groundwater beneath the NRTS with calcite and dolomite, care must be used in its utilization to avoid precipitation of solids.

Since 1952, the NRTS facilities (primarily the Test Reactor Area -- TRA, Idaho Chemical Processing Plant -- ICPP, and the Naval Reactor Facility -- NRF) have discharged 1.6×10<sup>10</sup> gallons of liquid waste containing 7×10<sup>4</sup> curies of radioactivity and about l×10<sup>8</sup> pounds of chemicals to the subsurface. The discharge has been disposed in wells and seepage ponds. The principal waste products include tritiated water, strontium:90, cesium-137, cobalt-60, sodium chloride, chromates, and heat. Wastes at the NRTS have been distributed in the Snake River Plain aquifer and overlying bodies of perched groundwater according to hydrologic and geochemical controls.

Expansion of the plume of waste products in the aquifer from the ICPP disposal well has been traced over the years; Chloride and tritium in this plume are most widely distributed, detectable over about 15 square miles of the aquifer. Migration of cationic waste products, especially strontium-90 and cesium-137, has been greatly retarded by sorption. Radioactive decay is a significant influence on the spreading and dilution of wastes as they move down-gradient in the aquifer. No detectable wastes have been found close to or beyond the southern boundary of the NRTS. Materials and heat balances calculated for the ICPP wastes indicate that the interpretive subsurface distributions are. valid and that the. wastes generally remain in the upper 250 feet of the aquifer. The balances indicate that heat and tritium are maintaining an equilibrium (nearly constant) inventory. Waste plumes from TRA and NRF are poorly defined because of insufficient observation wells.

## Crosthwaite1973

The results of drilling test holes to depths of approximately 1,000 feet in the Mud Lake region show that a large part of the region is underlain by both sedimentary deposits and basalt flows. At some locations, predominantly sedimentary deposits were penetrated; at others, basalt flows predominated. The so-called Mud Lake-Market Lake barrier denotes a change in geology. From the vicinity of the barrier area, as described by Stearns, Crandall, and Steward (1938, p. 111), up the water-table gradient for at least a few tens of miles, the saturated geologic section consists predominantly of beds of sediments that are intercalated with numerous basalt flows. Downgradient from the barrier, sedimentary deposits are not common and practically all the water-bearing formations are basalt, at least to the depths explored so far. Thus, the barrier is a transition zone from a sedimentary-basaltic sequence to a basaltic sequence. The sedimentary-basaltic sequence forms a complex hydrologic system in which water occurs under water-table conditions in the upper few tens of feet of saturated material and under artesian conditions in the deeper material in the southwest part of the region. The well data indicate that southwest of the barrier, artesian pressures are not significant. Southwest of the barrier, few sedimentary deposits occur in the basalt section and, as described by Mundorff, Crosthwaite, and Kilburn (1964). ground water occurs in a manner typical of the Snake Plain aquifer. In several wells, artesian pressures are higher in the deeper formations than in the shallower ones, but the reverse was found in a few wells. The available data are not adequate to describe the water-bearing characteristics of the artesian aquifer nor the effects that pumping in one zone would have on adjacent zones. The water-table aquifer yields large quantities of water to irrigation wells.

Although the Mud Lake region is within the Snake River Plain, the geology and hydrology of the region differs significantly from that of most of the Plain, and for this reason the aquifers in the region should be considered as separate hydrologic units. Geologic sections and a fence diagram show that sediments dominate in the region of the Mud Lake-Market Lake barrier whereas basalts are most common in adjoining areas. Tentative correlations of hydrologic units are shown in the cross sections and fence diagram.

As an aid to continued development of needed ground-water supplies in the Mud Lake region, the water-bearing characteristics of the deep artesian aquifers should be tested and exploration of aquifers occurring at depths greater than those penetrated to date should be undertaken.

Some thermal water sources of the Snake River basin, Idaho, are near saturation with respect to fluorite. That mineral was identified by X-ray diffraction in precipitates induced in three water samples by adding sodium fluoridc. The derived solubility product (K<sub>S0</sub>) for zero ionic strength was close to that calculated from Latimer's thermodynamic data (10<sup>-9.77</sup>). The relative ease of precipitation of fluorite from these water samples indicates that equilibrium with respect to fluorite may occur in some ground-water systems.

The present flood—control system at the National Reactor Testing Station consists of earth—fill embankments which partially dam flow in the Big Lost River, near the southwest corner of the station, and which confine the flow diverted at the dam to four spreading grounds (connected in series). Water passing through the dam flows northeastwardly in the river to accumulate in four dry lakes (terminus of the river). Water diverted into the spreading grounds may spill onto unimproved private lands.

Analyses of historical streamflow information indicate that floods in the Big Lost River would overtop the flood-control diversion dam about once every 55 years on the average; if the culverts in the dam are completely plugged, overtopping of the dam would occur about once every 16 years.

Effects of synthetically generated snowmelt floods on the flood-control system have been analyzed. These analyses indicate that the diversion dam will not be overtopped by a 300-year flood if the capacity of the diversion to the spreading grounds is doubled. The analyses also suggest that doubling the capacities of channels connecting spreading grounds would be prudent.

In connection with the establishment of reactor engineering facilities of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, the U.S. Geological Survey undertook in 1948 to help the Commission in appraising the geologic and hydrologic features of potential sites for construction and operation of a National Reactor Testing Station (NRTS).

The Commission selected a favorable site an area consisting of about 890 square miles of so-called sagebrush desert and basalt fields on the Snake River Plain of southern Idaho, near Arco, Idaho. The Commission required information about the amount, availability, and chemical quality of water at the NRTS, and about the extent to which use of water at the station might affect or deny use of water in areas outside the station. In 1949, the Commission estimated that the station soon would require about 60 cfs (cubic feet per second) of water and that demand would rise to about 100 cfs within 20 years.

Because knowledge of the hydrology of basalt is deficient, compared with knowledge about more ordinary types of aquifers such as sand and gravel, a systematic program was begun for collecting environmental data having possible bearing on basalt hydrology.

Areal geologic mapping and detailed stratigraphic studies of lithologic units were carried on with special attention to their hydrologic properties, including surface runoff, infiltration, and the occurrence, movement, quantity, and quality of ground water. These studies were aided by an exploratory drilling program which resulted in completion of 42 test holes by 1956. Other field investigations consisted of geophysical exploration, including seismic and electrical-resistivity surveying, gammaray and gamma-gamma-ray logging, and experimental terrestrial electro potential surveying; canvass of wells and water-level observations in and around the NRTS; investigations of local streams to obtain discharge data, channel capacities, and the interrelation of streamfiow with the occurrence, movement, and storage of ground water. Laboratory determinations included chemical and radiometric analyses of ground water and mineralogic, hydrologic, hydraulic, and geochemical characteristics of rock materials.

The NRTS is at the central-northern edge of the semiarid Snake River Plain in southern Idaho, adjacent to the southern foothills of the Lemhi and Lost River Ranges. North of the station, the Beaverhead and Centennial Mountains rise to form the Continental Divide, which is coincident with the Idaho-Montana boundary. A substantial part of the station occupies an area called the Pioneer Basin.

The plain consists largely of comparatively young volcanic rocks interbedded with lacustrine, eolian, and alluvial sediments. The surface of the plain is rolling to broken and is underlain everywhere by basalt, either at the surface or beneath a mantle of sediments. Hundreds of extinct volcanic craters and cones dot its surface.

The NRTS has no well defined integrated surface-water drainage system and it is not crossed by perennial streams. Flows in Big Lost River, Little Lost River, and Birch Creek, which drain the central-northern edge of the plain, generally terminate along the northern boundary of the station.

Landforms of the plain consist of volcanic features, alluvial features, lake floors and playas, and eolian features.

The climate of the Snake River Plain in the vicinity of the NRTS is semiarid. The precipitation and humidity generally are low, evaporation is rapid when moisture is available, and daily, monthly, and annual temperature ranges are large. Ground-surface conditions (such as snow and ice cover, wetness, and air temperature immediately above the ground) and shallow subsurface conditions (including soil moisture and temperature) vary widely with location and time.

Nine towns and villages, of which the principal industries are railroading, trucking, agriculture, and food processing, are situated within a 50-mile radius of the Central Facilities Area. On the uninhabited part of the plain, sheep and cattle grazing are the principal agricultural industries. The area is accessible by rail, highway, and air, and the station is traversed by all-weather paved highways.

Since 1949, various nuclear reactors have been operated and engineering facilities have been constructed within the station. These have been distributed into nine major program function areas; namely, Test Reactor Area, Idaho Chemical Processing Plant Area, Experimental Breeder Reactor-I (West) Area, Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (East) Area, Auxiliary Reactor Area, Naval Reactors Facility, Special Power Excursion Reactor Test Area, Central Facilities Area, and Test Area North. As of 1969, 22 reactors were operating or operable, and 26 had been dismantled, transferred, or were put on a standby status; 22 engineering facilities were in use, two were inactive, and two reactors were under construction.

Public water supply systems in small communities near the NRTS use ground water. Stock, rural domestic, and industrial water supplies also are chiefly ground water. Crop irrigation is chiefly with surface water, but extensive irrigation development with ground water has occurred on the Snake River Plain since 1946.

Water for use on the NRTS ordinarily is obtained from wells, chiefly for reactor cooling and moderating, as a cooling and shielding medium for temporary storage of spent nuclear-fuel elements, washing and decontaminating machinery and equipment, chemical processing, landscape maintenance, culinary and sanitary use, and fire protection. As of 1968, annual pumpage was about 2 billion gallons, of which about 50 percent was consumptively used.

## CrosthwaiteOthers1970b

The Big Lost River basin occupies about 1,400 square miles in south-central Idaho and drains to the Snake River Plain. The economy in the area is based on irrigation agriculture and stock raising. The basin is underlain by a diverse-assemblage of rocks which range, in age from Precambrian to Holocene. The assemblage is divided into five groups on the basis of their hydrologic characteristics. Carbonate rocks, noncarbonate rocks, cemented alluvial deposits, unconsolidated alluvial deposits, and basalt. The principal aquifer is unconsolidated alluvial fill that is several thousand feet thick in the main valley. The carbonate rocks are the major bedrock aquifer. They absorb a significant amount of precipitation and, in places, are very permeable as evidenced by large springs discharging from or near exposures of carbonate rocks. Only the alluvium, carbonate rock and locally the basalt yield significant amounts of water.

A total of about 67,000 acres is irrigated with water diverted from the Big Lost River. The annual flow of the river is highly variable and water-supply deficiencies are common. About 1 out of every 2 years is considered a drought year. In the period 1955-68, about 175 irrigation wells were drilled to provide a supplemental water supply to land irrigated from the canal system and to irrigate an additional 8,500 acres of new land.

Average annual precipitation ranged from 8 inches on the valley floor to about 50 inches at some higher elevations during the base period 1944-68. The estimated water yield of the Big Lost River basin averaged 650 cfs (cubic feet per second) for the base period. Of this amount, 150 cfs was transpired by crops, 75 cfs left the basin as streamflow, and 425 cfs left as ground-water flow. A map of precipitation and estimated values of evapotranspiration were used to construct a water-yield map.

A distinctive feature of the Big Lost River basin, is the large interchange of water from surface streams into the ground and from the ground into the surface streams. Large quantities of water disappear in the Chilly, Darlington, and other sinks and reappear above Mackay Narrows, above Moore Canal heading, and in other reaches. A cumulative summary of water yield upstream from selected points in the basin is as follows:<table class='table table-condensed' style='width: auto !important; '><thead><tr class='header'><th></th><th align='center'>Water yield (cfs)</th><th align='center'>Surface water (cfs)</th><th align='center'>Ground water (cfs)</th><th align='center'>Crop evapotrans-piration (cfs)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='odd'><td align='left'>Above Howell Ranch</td><td align='center'>345</td><td align='center'>310</td><td align='center'>35</td><td align='center'>&ndash;</td></tr><tr class='even'><td align='left'>Above Mackay Narrows</td><td align='center'>450</td><td align='center'>325</td><td align='center'>75</td><td align='center'>50</td></tr><tr class='odd'><td align='left'>Above Arco</td><td align='center'>650</td><td align='center'>75</td><td align='center'>425</td><td align='center'>150</td></tr></tbody></table>Ground-water pumping affects streamflow in reaches, where the stream and water table are continuous, but the effects of pumping were not measured except locally. Pumping depletes the total water supply by the. amount of the pumped water that is evapotranspired by crops. The part of the pumped water that is not consumed percolates into the ground or runs off over the land surface to the stream. The estimated 425 cfs that leaves the basin as ground-water flow is more than adequate for present and foreseeable needs. However because much of the outflow occurs at considerable depth, the quantity that is salvageable is unknown.

Both the surface and ground waters are of good quality and are suitable for most uses. Although these waters are low in total dissolved solids, they tend to be hard or very hard.

Nine hundred and eighty-seven curies of radioactive Xetss gas mixed with 2.83×10<sup>4</sup> m<sup>3</sup> of air was injected rapidly into permeable basalt strata at the National Reactor Testing Station, Idaho. A capping layer of fine-grained playa sediments confined the gas underground. The subsurface Xe<sup>133</sup> was monitored by Geiger-Muller (GM) detectors and by air samples from observation wells surrounding the injection well. Underground distribution patterns after injection pressures had dissipated were evaluated by materials-balance analyses. Most of the Xe<sup>133</sup> apparently remained underground and decayed radioactively. Molecular diffusion rates of Xe<sup>133</sup> from the ground were estimated using a simplified mathematical model. A maximum flux rate of 2,560 µc/hr from a ground-atmosphere interface area of 2.67×10<sup>5</sup> m<sup>2</sup> was calculated for the first day after injection. The estimated rates indicated a total diffusion loss of 0.37 c for the total area during the 26-day observation period. The calculated rates had fairly good agreement with the measured flux rates at the ground surface. Erratic variations in the measured flux rates were attributed to other influences such as barometric-pressure changes.

## Robertson1969

Nine hundred eighty-seven curies (Ci) of radioactive Xe-133 gas were injected rapidly under pressures of 1.5 to 1.65 psi with one million cubic feet of air into permeable basalt strata at the National Reactor Testing Station, Idaho. A capping layer of semipermeable fine-grained playa sediments confined the gas underground. The subsurface Xe-133 was monitored by Geiger-Müller detectors and by air samples from observation wells surrounding the injection well. Underground distribution patterns after injection pressures had dissipated were evaluated by materials-balance analyses. The results indicated that most of the Xe-133 remained underground and decayed radioactively, and that the underground air-sample analysis data provided by Texas Instruments, Inc., were erroneously low by a factor of approximately 10. Molecular diffusion rates of Xe-133 from the ground were estimated using a simplified numerical model. A maximum flux rate of 2,560 µCi/hr from a ground-atmosphere interface of 2.88×10<sup>6</sup> ft<sup>2</sup> was calculated for the first day after injection. The estimated rates indicated a total diffusion loss of 0.37 Ci for the total area during the 26-day observation period. The calculated rates had fairly good agreement with the measured, very low flux rates at the ground surface. Erratic variations in the flux rates measured by Texas Instruments, Inc., and Isotopes, A Teledyne Company, were attributed to other influences such as barometric pressure changes. The effects of barometric pressure on the vertical flow rates of Xe-133 were estimated for the maximum possible conditions. Theoretically, a maximum pressure differential of 0.40 inch of mercury across 10 feet of playa sediments could induce an air flow of 65 ft<sup>3</sup>/ft<sup>2</sup>/day in the small zone where the sediment cover is thinnest (about seven feet) and Xe-133 concentrations were highest. Average rates over the whole test area should have been much lower because of thicker sediments (average of 43 feet) and lower concentrations; however, they could have been comparable in magnitude to the molecular diffusion rates. It is concluded that molecular diffusion and barometric effects could produce the flux rates measured; however, the rates too low to remove a significant portion of the 987 Ci of Xe-133, nearly all of which remained underground and decayed, radioactively. Although they are only approximate, the general methods and techniques used for the diffusion, materials balance, and barometric analyses were generally satisfactory and could be applied to future underground gas-injection problems.

The hydrologic effects of disposal radioactive waste to the ground at the National Reactor Testing Station was studied. Collection and analyses of ground- and surface-water samples for radiometric and chemical changes were made. Results were evaluated mapped. Ground-water levels were also mapped over the station. The net ground-water consumption after pumpage waste injection was determined. Two billion gallons of water were pumped during 1966 of which 40 percent was metered and returned to the Snake Plain aquifer. A record runoff of the Big Lost River during 1965 and 1966 induced a large amount recharge to the Snake Plain aquifer. The recharge caused water levels to rise as much as six feet. but apparently did not have a great effect on the concentrations of waste products in the ground water. Pressure transmission, or mass transfer effects from the recharge. were observed as far as 50 miles southwest the river. Tritium is the primary radioactive waste product discharged to the subsurface. Several aspects of tritium disposal were studied at the TRA (Test Reactor Area) and the ICPP (Idaho Chemical Processing Plant) areas. The distribution waste tritium in the Snake Plain aquifer was mapped. and background levels were determined to range from 0.05 to 0.1 pCi/ml. Waste tritium in water from the Snake Plain aquifer was detected 4&frac12; miles south of the ICPP. An estimated mass balance of total tritium remaining in the Snake Plain aquifer is presented for the TRA and ICPP areas. About 21,500 Ci (curies) tritium at the ICPP and about 3,700 Ci at the TRA were disposed from 1952 through 1966. About 14,000 Ci and 2,700 Ci of tritium, respectively, should remain after radioactive decay. Similar amounts are indicated to be present in the ground water. Waste tritium has been used as a tracer in studies of the complex now characteristics the aquifer in the ICPP area. Dissolved Cr was used to trace TRA pond waste water in perched ground-water bodies and downgradient 2&frac12; miles in the Snake Plain aquifer. Concentrations of hexavalent Cr ranged as high as 1.7 ppM in the perched water 0.4 ppM in the water from the Snake Plain aquifer. Chromium serves as a tracer or TRA wastes because it does not occur in nearby ICPP wastes. is usually present in natural waters, and can be determined in very low concentrations. Natural fluoride in the water the Snake Plain aquifer was used to trace the flow downgradient from the northeast end of the Snake River Plain. The fluoride, which is dissolved from certain rocks, indicates recharge areas and flow paths in the aquifer. A project to test the feasibility of disposing radioactive gases into the is presently underway. A seismic survey was used to map surface sediment thickness, and two test wells were cored to evaluate potential injection-well sites. A “breathing” well was instrumented to study flow rates, temperature, humidity, and other aspects of vertical flow air in the well. Results of the continuing study are presented. Studies made on several wells which had vertically flowing borehole water indicated that the physical and chemical of the water are by the flow. One well with downward flow a head difference of 0.01 to 0.07 foot between two permeable zones throughout the year.

## Morris1967

Chemical and radioactive tracers were used in studies of the geology and the hydrology of the basalt terrane at the National Reactor Testing Station. A salt tracer, used near waste disposal from the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant, indicated rates of flow ranging from 15 to 50 ft/day in the regional groundwater reservoir, and a sodium fluorescein dye indicated an average rate of flow of about 23 ft/day. Recent studies using tritium Indicated average rates of flow of about 54 ft/day based on “first arrival” and from 10 to 13 ft/day based on the arrival of the “center of mass” or maximum tritium concentration. Studies of the water perched in the alluvium and basalt underlying the Test Reactor Area indicated a rate of flow of about 2–10 ft/day. Long‐range tritium, studies in the regional groundwater reservoir in the Central Facilities Area indicated rates of flow of 6-8 ft/day under normal hydraulic gradients of 5 ft/mile at distances of 4-5 miles from points of injection.

## Olmsted1964

Most of the ground water in the National Reactor Testing Station is of the calcium magnesium bicarbonate type. The percent sodium decreases northwestward, where the source of recharge is a limestone and dolomite terrane, and increases southeastward, where the source is in silicic volcanic rocks and lacustrine deposits.

## Walker1964

Surface geology and records from wells and test holes as deep as 1,497 feet are used to describe and interpret the subsurface geology of the National Reactor Testing Station.

The station is underlain, to depths still unknown, by the Snake River Group, which consists of basalt flows, and by some interbedded lake and stream deposits derived from the mountains to the north. A thick sequence of lavas with few and thin interbeds underlies the southeastern part of the station. Between this area and the mountains there is a belt about 10 miles wide in which considerable masses of sedimentary materials are interbedded in the lavas. The bulk of this material is silt with some fine-grained sand and clay; there are lesser amounts of coarser grained stream deposits.

The bulk of the sedimentary deposits occurs in large masses. One such mass is at and near the surface, another at intermediate depth, and the third at the greatest depths explored. These strata probably were deposited during wet periods of high runoff that coincided with substages of glaciation in the mountains.

Unsaturated deposits 50 feet or more thick underlie about 175 square miles of the station, and those at least 100 feet thick underlie about 110 square miles. One well shows 262 feet of unsaturated material. There probably are somewhat more than 4 cubic miles of unsaturated deposits beneath the station, counting only the area where the thickness is 50 feet or more. Most of this material is fine grained.

## Jones1963a

Appraisal of the capacity of basalt aquifers and associated sediments to receive and attenuate radioactive waste required the development and application of new tools and methods of investigation. Borehole geophysics and modified oil-well testing techniques have been effectively employed at the National Reactor Testing Station (NRTS) in southeastern Idaho. Aquifers have been identified, their ability to transmit water has been qualitatively evaluated, they have been correlated for distances of somewhat more than a mile, and the hydraulic head and quality of their water has been determined. Results of studies to date prove that the pattern of flow is more closely related to the geometry of the aquifer system than to the direction of the regional hydraulic gradient. It appears that hydrologic data necessary for analysis of the factors of waste attenuation in this can be obtained, and detailed investigations are now in progress.

## Jones1963b

The maximum apparent velocity of ground-water flow in basalt aquifers beneath the eastern part of the Snake River Plain in southeastern Idaho has been measured with chemical and radioactive tracers for distances up to 3,500 feet in a single aquifer. Maximum apparent velocities observed in the single-aquifer test ranged from 24 to 141 feet per day, under hydraulic gradients of 0.21 to 1.06 feet in 1,000 feet. There was no relationship between the hydraulic gradient and the apparent velocity.

Apparent rates of flow over distances in excess of 25 miles ranged from 12 to 16 feet per day, on the basis of the decay rate of tritium in the ground water.
